Compiled using SponsorUniteds proprietary platform data from June 2022 through January 2023, the report analyzed NFL sponsorships across the league, teams, and individual athletes. Rather than relying on a handful of household brands to grow revenues, NFL teams are driving exponential growth by diversifying their brand partners, said Bob Lynch, Founder and CEO of SponsorUnited. Ticketing, Insurance, and Healthcare were the leading brand categories in terms of revenue growth this season. The NFLs sponsor portfolio isnt slowing down anytime soon, as emergent categories like Sports Betting and Wine Spirits are expected to increase their spend in the years ahead. Key findings from the report include Sports bettings explosive growth unlocks new revenue opportunities Sports Betting has become a key revenue stream for the NFL, increasing 40 across teams. Sports Betting deals have quadrupled in the last four years 20192022, while gambling companies accelerated their ad spend last year. More than 25 NFL teams now have at least one Sports Betting or Daily Fantasy Sport sponsor. Last year, the Buffalo Bills announced a multiyear partnership with FanDuel as their official mobile sports betting partner. Other notable brand sponsors include BetMGM, Ballys, Betfred, and Bet365. Russell Wilson leads Austin Ekeler as social medias most endorsed athlete Russell Wilson of the Denver Broncos leads social media branded endorsements with 22 deals, closely trailed by the LA Chargers Austin Ekeler with 21 social deals. While Wilsons social following dwarfs that of the Chargers running back 14M vs. 320K, respectively, Ekelers deal volume reflects his considerable appeal to brand partners, given his onfield performance and ability to reach new audiences as an influencer in the esports space. Wilson and Ekeler are the only NFL players with over 20 social brand deals. The next mostendorsed players include the Kansas City Chiefs JuJu SmithSchuster 15 endorsements and Travis Kelce 14 endorsements, and Tyler Lockett of the Seattle Seahawks 13 endorsements. NFL team sponsorship revenue reaches new heights this season Sponsorship revenue totaled 2.05B across the 32 NFL teams in the 20222023 seasona new league record, and a 14 increase yearoveryear. When combined with the league as a whole, total sponsorship revenue was 2.7B. Key growth drivers include the Apple Music Halftime Show and new sponsors like Socios and regional Healthcare brands. Alcohol brands lead in deal volume Led by spirit brands, Alcohol again topped the category list for brand spend, with 333 sponsorships across NFL teams and the league as a whole. Technology brands came in second with 218 sponsorships, and Food Products brands third with 177 deals. While the Alcohol category led by number of deals across the league and teams, it was second in revenue for teamonly deals with 170M, trailing the firstplace Finance category with 210M and topping Healthcare at 145M. The NFL is going global in a big way The leagues ambitious strategy to grow its international footprint took a giant leap forward with the launch of its international home marketing areas IHMA initiative in January 2022, granting teams access to foreign territories for marketing and fan engagement. Currently, 19 teams have access to 30 IMHAs across 10 countriesled by the Los Angeles Rams 4, Miami Dolphins 3, and the Philadelphia Eagles 3. The goal to become a global powerhouse by growing its fan base 26 to a staggering 240M worldwide, and focusing on key international markets like the UK and Germany.

The 2022 season will bring the first change from the leagues new domestic broadcast deals which saw basically every package remain with the same network. The only difference for now is that Thursday night games will solely be on Amazon, with no more coverage on traditional TV after Prime Video stepped up its commitment and took the rights exclusively. The leagues agreements with its other media rights partners are set to come into effect next campaign. Rather than bombard its loyal fanbase with a host of changes all at the same time, the NFL has instead introduced those incrementally. In the last few years we have seen the number of regular season games grow to 17 , postseason expansion, playoff games on ESPN , the creep of streaming, experimental broadcasts and even the introduction of leaguesanctioned betting . This is a new era which has very much been introduced via stealth. In addition to the increased revenues it will eventually receive from the new broadcast deals, the latest new toy is NFL . Sitting within the NFL app, the leagues new directtoconsumer DTC service not only steps up to replace former mobile live game rights partners in the US, but also the Game Pass overthetop OTT platform. It is a vintage NFL move under commissioner Roger Goodell, measured to the point of caution. It is for others to make predictions about what will happen on the field, but if there is one prediction to be made about the NFL this season it is that this is a forkintheroad moment for embracing streaming. In addition to Amazons exclusive Thursday night games and the rollout of NFL, the decision to award Sunday Ticket is due imminently. Apple, Google and ESPN, along with Amazon, have all been linked with taking the outofmarket package to a digital platform. Goodell says DirecTVs successor will be named in the autumn. What else is different this year? Well, several key partners have adjusted their deals, with both Pepsi and AnheuserBusch InBev scaling back their Super Bowl sponsorships, leaving major inventory for the NFL to sell ahead of its showpiece next February. Pepsis decision to give up its halftime show sponsorship, in particular, will mean a very different look for whichever brand succeeds the soft drinks giant. With the pandemic now firmly in the rearview mirror, international expansion is also back on the NFL agenda. This season will see the first regular season game in Germany , with former World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper brought in to oversee an expanded European operation. The league also returns to Mexico City as part of a fivegame International Series, which will also see three games at two stadiums in London. For the first time teams have also been given permission to market themselves overseas . The International Home Marketing Areas IHMA programme has been in full swing during the offseason with franchises striking their first deals in newlyacquired territory. Unsurprisingly, the UK, Germany and Mexico have been the focus, but new team partnerships have been struck as far afield as China and New Zealand. Americas game is back, but it is spreading the starspangled banner further than ever before.

Scott W. GrauIcon Sportswire via Getty Images U.S. sports leagues and teams have recently embraced new sponsorship categories, like cryptocurrency, and auctioned off the real estate on their jerseys, where the highest bidder can plant company logos. In both cases, the NFL said, not so fast. Its easy to move judiciously when you are the richest sports league in the world and most teams turn a ninefigure profit. NFL sponsorship revenue rose 4 during the 2022 season to a record 1.88 billion, according to a new report from consultancy IEG and its Sponsorship Intelligence Database, 15 ahead of the NBA. They stayed squeaky clean during the whole thing, Peter Laatz, IEGs global managing director, said in a video interview regarding the crypto sponsorship mess. They were, as they often are in the best of ways, extremely late to the marketplace. But they were late for a reason. The NFL did not allow deals with crypto exchanges FTX, Coinbase and Crypto.com, and only approved blockchain companies like Socios, which signed 13 NFL teams to deals for 2022. So, while cryptocurrency was the second biggest sponsorship category for the NBA during the 202122 season, it was not on the NFLs radar. Technology is the most lucrative industry for football, with nearly 400 million in sponsorship revenue, per IEG. Sports betting 260 million, beer 211 million, telecom 163 million and insurance 133 million also cracked the top five. Four of the top 10 spending brands were tech companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Cisco Systems and Apple . In addition, technology brands Acronis, Amazon Web Services, HCL Technologies and Shift4 added deals with multiple teams. IEGs research has the NFL ahead of the NBA 1.64 billion on sponsorships, as well as MLB 1.19 billion, NHL 753 million and MLS 677 million. The 4 increase in sponsorship revenue is slower than the previous years 12, when a flood of sports gambling partnerships drove significant gains. Rights fees in that category jumped 140 yearoveryear and went from being the eighth biggest brand category to second largest behind technology. IEGs figures factor in team and leaguelevel deals but are estimated sponsorship rights fees and do not include media advertising or player endorsement income. In May, Pepsi announced it would not return as the Super Bowl halftime show sponsor after a decade in the roleBridgestone was the prior halftime sponsor. Apple Music replaced the soft drink giant under a 50 millionayear pact. The endemic kind of underwriting by a strong music platform was smart, Laatz said. I think it's going to help them on the backside with artist acquisition and all kinds of extensions they can do. Pepsi walked away from the Super Bowl halftime sponsorship, but it did not leave the NFL. In fact, it spent more on football sponsorship rights during the 2022 season than any other brand, with AnheuserBusch InBev and Verizon up next. PepsiCo shifted its budget to other NFL assets, such as the NFL Draft. It also has individual team deals with more than a dozen clubs. In addition to being a league partner, AnheuserBusch has deals with 26 teams. IEG tracked 53 active leaguelevel partnerships. Barclays, Bose, Bridgestone, Ford Trucks, Pizza Hut and PointsBet exited the league after the 2021 season, but new sponsors, including Apple Music, Bread Financial, E J Gallo Winery, Little Caesars and NoBull, came aboard. When you do a leaguelevel deal, you are essentially buying the right to spend more money, Laatz said. You generally get access to ancillary events, but in terms of getting access to the actual game day action, you have to go to the clubs. The Cincinnati Bengals missed a chance to make Super Bowl LVII with their lastsecond loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship game but had a 50 increase in sponsorship revenue, according to IEG. The Bengals have traditionally ranked among the lowest grossing teams on sponsor revenue, but the club benefited from its surprise run to last years Super Bowl, as well as its first stadium naming rights partner. In August, software company Paycor signed a 16year deal to rename Paul Brown Stadium. The Pittsburgh Steelers also got a new naming rights partner when financial tech firm Acrisure replaced Heinz in a deal worth roughly 10 million per year, more than triple the previous annual rate. The breakdown of sponsorship revenue in the NFL is split roughly 5050 between the league and its teams. It differs from the other U.S. sports leagues, where teams typically generate upwards of 70 of the dollars. Laatz says NFL teams are still restricted in their deals by the radius of marketing outside their home territories and the lack of TVvisible signage.

GlobalData Analytics and visualisation solutions has contributed positively when preparing management presentations and strategic papers. Business Intelligence Marketing Manager, SAL Heavy Lift COVID19 has caused significant interference to our business and the COVID19 intelligence from GlobalData has helped us reach better decisions around strategy. These two highlights have helped enormously to understand the projections into the future concerning our business units, we also utilise the project database to source new projects for LiebherrWerk to use as an additional source to pitch for new business.

We also use your market data in our Strategic Business Process to support our business decisions. By having everything in one place on the Intelligence Center it has saved me a lot of time versus looking on different sources, the alert function also helps with this. Head of Key Accounts, Saab AB Having used several other market research companies, I find that GlobalData manages to provide that difficulttoget market data that others cant, as well as very diverse and complete consumer surveys. Marketing Intelligence Manager, Portugal Foods Our experience with GlobalData has been very good, from the platform itself to the people. I find that the analysts and the account team have a high level of customer focus and responsiveness and therefore I can always rely on. The platform is more holistic than other providers. It is convenient and almost like a one stop shop. The pricing suite is highly competitive and value for our organisation. I like reports that inform new segments such as the analysis on generation Z, millennials, the impact of COVID 19 to our banking customers and their new channel habits. Secondly the specialist insight on affluent sector significantly increases our understanding about this group of customers. The combination of those give us depth and breadth of the evolving market. Im in the business of answering and helping people make decisions so with the intelligence center I can do that, effectively and efficiently. I can share quickly key insights that answer and satisfy our country stakeholders by giving them many quality studies and primary research about competitive landscape beyond the outlook of our bank. It helps me be seen as an advisory partner and that makes a big difference. A big benefit of our subscription is that no one holds the whole data and because it allows so many people, so many different parts of our organisation have access, it enables all teams to have the same level of knowledge and decision support.

Moreover, using GlobalData products has helped increase my knowledge of the finance sector, the players within it, and the general threats and opportunities. I find the consumer surveys that are carried out to be extremely beneficial and not something I have seen anywhere else. They provided an insightful view of why and which consumers take or dont particular financial products. This can help shape conversations with clients to ensure they make the right strategic decisions for their business. One of the challenges I have found is that data in the payments space is often piecemeal. With GD all of the data I need is in one place, but it also comes with additional market reports that provide useful extra context and information. Having the ability to setup alerts on relevant movements in the industry, be it competitors or customers, and have them emailed directly to me, ensures I get early sight of industry activity and dont have to search for news.

Source Comperemedia Omni What we think COVID19s impact on sports and fans across the country creates an opportunity for insurers to breathe life into their longstanding sponsorships. Insurers have long utilized the love of sports and the massive audiences that they draw as a way to generate top of funnel, brand awareness. Sports fans are passionate, loyal, and attentive, which makes them a prime target on game day for advertisers. As COVID19 has continued to impact sports, fans, and game day experiences, insurers should capitalize on this reality to do more than build awareness they should aim to build relationships, trust, and even loyalty. Fans wont forget who made this challenging year a bit more bearable, and those extra efforts wont go unnoticed in the long run. Insurers should bring their sponsorship and awareness marketing to life by creating real opportunities for fans to get one step closer to their beloved teams and sports.

Beyond that, however, they have outperformed Fortune 500 companies with a remarkable decadelong CAGR of almost 10, outperforming these companies by 38 annually. How did they do it in a nutshell? Theyve leveraged innovation and change to evolve the business in both slow and fast ways. Developed and enhanced nonvenue marketing platforms and content to generate value for brands in the wake of COVID think podcasts, video series, social expansion. Adopted an omnichannel approach in a changing advertising environment, resulting in 20 more assets being delivered to brands in the last 5 years. Capitalized on NIL and athletes' growing social following and deals to create a new pipeline of potential partners. Embraced new industries, nontraditional sponsorships, and highgrowth startups flooding the market due to the massive deployment of venture capital over the past few years. Continued to maintain focus on growing and maintaining their key enterprise sponsors, such as AnheuserBusch , Verizon , and PepsiCo , resulting in the top 10 largest spending brands delivering 22 of total team sponsorship revenues. Theyve capitalized on much of this growth without the benefit of introducing jersey patches, new teams, or TVvisible signage. That said, when they did move a club like the Las Vegas Raiders to a new market with a new stadium, they saw massive returns 691 growth in a 36month period for the club. The NFL's approach to sponsorships exemplifies a blend of tradition and innovation, demonstrating that even in rapidly changing markets, there's tremendous value in adaptability and strategic growth. This model not only ensures the league's continued dominance in the sports industry but also provides valuable insights for brands and marketers looking to elevate their own strategies. sponsorship sportsbiz nfl 163 2 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Lee Zohlman Executive Sports Luxury IndyCar F1 Sponsorship B Dev Leader Creating Partnerships that Build Business, Generate Revenue, Increase Brand Recognition Expert Facilitator 2X Ironman 1y Report this comment And their ability to impact target audiences of all ages while staying relevant and authentic with each demo is spot on!

Compiled using SponsorUniteds proprietary platform data from June 2022 through January 2023, the report analyzed NFL sponsorships across the league, teams, and individual athletes. Rather than relying on a handful of household brands to grow revenues, NFL teams are driving exponential growth by diversifying their brand partners, said Bob Lynch, Founder and CEO of SponsorUnited. Ticketing, Insurance, and Healthcare were the leading brand categories in terms of revenue growth this season. The NFLs sponsor portfolio isnt slowing down anytime soon, as emergent categories like Sports Betting and Wine Spirits are expected to increase their spend in the years ahead. Key findings from the report include Sports bettings explosive growth unlocks new revenue opportunities Sports Betting has become a key revenue stream for the NFL, increasing 40 across teams. Sports Betting deals have quadrupled in the last four years 20192022, while gambling companies accelerated their ad spend last year. More than 25 NFL teams now have at least one Sports Betting or Daily Fantasy Sport sponsor. Last year, the Buffalo Bills announced a multiyear partnership with FanDuel as their official mobile sports betting partner. Other notable brand sponsors include BetMGM, Ballys, Betfred, and Bet365. Russell Wilson leads Austin Ekeler as social medias most endorsed athlete Russell Wilson of the Denver Broncos leads social media branded endorsements with 22 deals, closely trailed by the LA Chargers Austin Ekeler with 21 social deals. While Wilsons social following dwarfs that of the Chargers running back 14M vs. 320K, respectively, Ekelers deal volume reflects his considerable appeal to brand partners, given his onfield performance and ability to reach new audiences as an influencer in the esports space. Wilson and Ekeler are the only NFL players with over 20 social brand deals. The next mostendorsed players include the Kansas City Chiefs JuJu SmithSchuster 15 endorsements and Travis Kelce 14 endorsements, and Tyler Lockett of the Seattle Seahawks 13 endorsements. NFL team sponsorship revenue reaches new heights this season Sponsorship revenue totaled 2.05B across the 32 NFL teams in the 20222023 seasona new league record, and a 14 increase yearoveryear. When combined with the league as a whole, total sponsorship revenue was 2.7B. Key growth drivers include the Apple Music Halftime Show and new sponsors like Socios and regional Healthcare brands. Alcohol brands lead in deal volume Led by spirit brands, Alcohol again topped the category list for brand spend, with 333 sponsorships across NFL teams and the league as a whole. Technology brands came in second with 218 sponsorships, and Food Products brands third with 177 deals. While the Alcohol category led by number of deals across the league and teams, it was second in revenue for teamonly deals with 170M, trailing the firstplace Finance category with 210M and topping Healthcare at 145M. The NFL is going global in a big way The leagues ambitious strategy to grow its international footprint took a giant leap forward with the launch of its international home marketing areas IHMA initiative in January 2022, granting teams access to foreign territories for marketing and fan engagement. Currently, 19 teams have access to 30 IMHAs across 10 countriesled by the Los Angeles Rams 4, Miami Dolphins 3, and the Philadelphia Eagles 3. The goal to become a global powerhouse by growing its fan base 26 to a staggering 240M worldwide, and focusing on key international markets like the UK and Germany. By hosting games and sponsored events and investing in youth football programs overseas, the NFL is actively cultivating its next generation of fans. Jointly authored by SponsorUniteds Business Intelligence, Analytics, and Marketing Departments, the report offers an indepth analysis of more than 4,000 brands, 350 athletes, 3,100 deals, and 34,000 posts between the league, clubs, athletes, and brands during the 2022 season.

Scott W. GrauIcon Sportswire via Getty Images U.S. sports leagues and teams have recently embraced new sponsorship categories, like cryptocurrency, and auctioned off the real estate on their jerseys, where the highest bidder can plant company logos. In both cases, the NFL said, not so fast. Its easy to move judiciously when you are the richest sports league in the world and most teams turn a ninefigure profit. NFL sponsorship revenue rose 4 during the 2022 season to a record 1.88 billion, according to a new report from consultancy IEG and its Sponsorship Intelligence Database, 15 ahead of the NBA. They stayed squeaky clean during the whole thing, Peter Laatz, IEGs global managing director, said in a video interview regarding the crypto sponsorship mess. They were, as they often are in the best of ways, extremely late to the marketplace. But they were late for a reason. The NFL did not allow deals with crypto exchanges FTX, Coinbase and Crypto.com, and only approved blockchain companies like Socios, which signed 13 NFL teams to deals for 2022. So, while cryptocurrency was the second biggest sponsorship category for the NBA during the 202122 season, it was not on the NFLs radar. Technology is the most lucrative industry for football, with nearly 400 million in sponsorship revenue, per IEG. Sports betting 260 million, beer 211 million, telecom 163 million and insurance 133 million also cracked the top five. Four of the top 10 spending brands were tech companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Cisco Systems and Apple . In addition, technology brands Acronis, Amazon Web Services, HCL Technologies and Shift4 added deals with multiple teams. IEGs research has the NFL ahead of the NBA 1.64 billion on sponsorships, as well as MLB 1.19 billion, NHL 753 million and MLS 677 million. The 4 increase in sponsorship revenue is slower than the previous years 12, when a flood of sports gambling partnerships drove significant gains. Rights fees in that category jumped 140 yearoveryear and went from being the eighth biggest brand category to second largest behind technology. IEGs figures factor in team and leaguelevel deals but are estimated sponsorship rights fees and do not include media advertising or player endorsement income. In May, Pepsi announced it would not return as the Super Bowl halftime show sponsor after a decade in the roleBridgestone was the prior halftime sponsor. Apple Music replaced the soft drink giant under a 50 millionayear pact. The endemic kind of underwriting by a strong music platform was smart, Laatz said. I think it's going to help them on the backside with artist acquisition and all kinds of extensions they can do. Pepsi walked away from the Super Bowl halftime sponsorship, but it did not leave the NFL. In fact, it spent more on football sponsorship rights during the 2022 season than any other brand, with AnheuserBusch InBev and Verizon up next. PepsiCo shifted its budget to other NFL assets, such as the NFL Draft. It also has individual team deals with more than a dozen clubs. In addition to being a league partner, AnheuserBusch has deals with 26 teams. IEG tracked 53 active leaguelevel partnerships. Barclays, Bose, Bridgestone, Ford Trucks, Pizza Hut and PointsBet exited the league after the 2021 season, but new sponsors, including Apple Music, Bread Financial, E J Gallo Winery, Little Caesars and NoBull, came aboard. When you do a leaguelevel deal, you are essentially buying the right to spend more money, Laatz said. You generally get access to ancillary events, but in terms of getting access to the actual game day action, you have to go to the clubs. The Cincinnati Bengals missed a chance to make Super Bowl LVII with their lastsecond loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship game but had a 50 increase in sponsorship revenue, according to IEG. The Bengals have traditionally ranked among the lowest grossing teams on sponsor revenue, but the club benefited from its surprise run to last years Super Bowl, as well as its first stadium naming rights partner. In August, software company Paycor signed a 16year deal to rename Paul Brown Stadium. The Pittsburgh Steelers also got a new naming rights partner when financial tech firm Acrisure replaced Heinz in a deal worth roughly 10 million per year, more than triple the previous annual rate. The breakdown of sponsorship revenue in the NFL is split roughly 5050 between the league and its teams. It differs from the other U.S. sports leagues, where teams typically generate upwards of 70 of the dollars. Laatz says NFL teams are still restricted in their deals by the radius of marketing outside their home territories and the lack of TVvisible signage.

Pizza Hut exited its league deal after four seasons, replaced by Little Caesars. The NFL also signed EJ Gallo and its Barefoot Wine line as an official sponsor part of the league's alcohol category opening up after a new, revised deal with AnheuserBusch InBev. Diageo has snagged the spirits category for the NFL, as well as the red hot readytodrink cocktails category. Additionally, Bread Financials Comenity Bank has replaced Barclays a partner since 2010 as a provider of cobranded NFL and team affinity credit cards. Gone from the fold this season is Bridgestone tires, which had been a league sponsor since 2007. Barclays a sponsor since 2010, Bose 2011 and Ford Trucks 2015 also exited league deals.

The 2022 season will bring the first change from the leagues new domestic broadcast deals which saw basically every package remain with the same network. The only difference for now is that Thursday night games will solely be on Amazon, with no more coverage on traditional TV after Prime Video stepped up its commitment and took the rights exclusively. The leagues agreements with its other media rights partners are set to come into effect next campaign. Rather than bombard its loyal fanbase with a host of changes all at the same time, the NFL has instead introduced those incrementally. In the last few years we have seen the number of regular season games grow to 17 , postseason expansion, playoff games on ESPN , the creep of streaming, experimental broadcasts and even the introduction of leaguesanctioned betting . This is a new era which has very much been introduced via stealth. In addition to the increased revenues it will eventually receive from the new broadcast deals, the latest new toy is NFL . Sitting within the NFL app, the leagues new directtoconsumer DTC service not only steps up to replace former mobile live game rights partners in the US, but also the Game Pass overthetop OTT platform. It is a vintage NFL move under commissioner Roger Goodell, measured to the point of caution. It is for others to make predictions about what will happen on the field, but if there is one prediction to be made about the NFL this season it is that this is a forkintheroad moment for embracing streaming. In addition to Amazons exclusive Thursday night games and the rollout of NFL, the decision to award Sunday Ticket is due imminently. Apple, Google and ESPN, along with Amazon, have all been linked with taking the outofmarket package to a digital platform. Goodell says DirecTVs successor will be named in the autumn. What else is different this year? Well, several key partners have adjusted their deals, with both Pepsi and AnheuserBusch InBev scaling back their Super Bowl sponsorships, leaving major inventory for the NFL to sell ahead of its showpiece next February. Pepsis decision to give up its halftime show sponsorship, in particular, will mean a very different look for whichever brand succeeds the soft drinks giant. With the pandemic now firmly in the rearview mirror, international expansion is also back on the NFL agenda. This season will see the first regular season game in Germany , with former World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper brought in to oversee an expanded European operation. The league also returns to Mexico City as part of a fivegame International Series, which will also see three games at two stadiums in London. For the first time teams have also been given permission to market themselves overseas . The International Home Marketing Areas IHMA programme has been in full swing during the offseason with franchises striking their first deals in newlyacquired territory. Unsurprisingly, the UK, Germany and Mexico have been the focus, but new team partnerships have been struck as far afield as China and New Zealand. Americas game is back, but it is spreading the starspangled banner further than ever before.

Before the 2020 NFL season even started, 67 players chose to opt out of playing due to health concerns as the US continued to grapple with the effects of the Covid19 pandemic. The absence of a preseason, coupled with a delayed training camp, cast further doubt on the already uncertain prospect of the 2020 season going ahead as normal. And yet, remarkably, despite rising coronavirus cases across the US at the peak of the second wave, only five of 256 regular season games were postponed, with ten rescheduled to accommodate the changes. However, the season was not without its hiccups. There were a number of outbreaks within teams, the first of those being the Tennessee Titans, whose week four game against the Pittsburgh Steelers was postponed . In week 12, the highly anticipated divisional game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers was delayed three times due to an even bigger outbreak, which placed 23 players on the reserveCovid19 list, including star quarterback Lamar Jackson. The Titans and the Ravens were among several teams to be handed Covidrelated fines by the NFL, alongside the New England Patriots, Las Vegas Raiders and New Orleans Saints. Following the unprecedented events of 2020, there has at last been a sense of things returning to normal for the NFL throughout the offseason. At the 2021 NFL Draft in Cleveland back in April, for example, firstround picks were once again able to attend the ceremony and greet league commissioner Roger Goodell on stage, with 160,000 fans attending over the three days. The New England Patriots selected quarterback Mac Jones 15th overall in this years NFL draft in Cleveland Still, though, one pressing concern for the NFL over the offseason has been the vaccination of players, coaches and staff before the new campaign begins. The league has rolled out updated Covid19 protocols that offer clear incentives for players to get vaccinated, while the NFLs general counsel Lawrence Ferazani has said that the organisation would welcome a vaccine mandate for its athletes. In any case, those individuals who have received their jabs will be able to enjoy several liberties this season, but the league has introduced stringent testing and containment measures for others who refuse to take the vaccine. Failure to comply to the new rules could have damaging consequences on NFL teams this season. If an unvaccinated player refuses to wear a mask, breaks social distancing rules, or attends a large gathering of over 15 people without masks, the league will sanction fines starting at US14,650. Teams will also forfeit games if an outbreak among its unvaccinated players causes the cancellation of a fixture. A message from Commissioner Goodell ahead of the 2021 season. WeRunAsOne pic.twitter.comcpJnBTUuXH NFL NFL September 9, 2021 On a more positive note, all 32 franchises have been given the goahead to have full stadiums during the upcoming season, which will be well received after the financial impact of playing behind closed doors or in front of limited crowds in 2020. Indeed, the NFL suffered a 20 per cent drop in revenue last year, according to Forbes annual list of the most valuable NFL teams , which also estimates that teams average operating income fell to US7.1 million last year, down from US109 million in 2019. Despite the financial consequences of the pandemic, it would appear that NFL teams havent become any less valuable, with Forbes calculating that the average franchise valuation has actually increased by 14 per cent over the last year to US3.48 billion the biggest gain in five years. NFL teams will also be buoyed by the leagues newly signed domestic media rights deals with CBS, ESPNABC, Fox, NBC and Amazon, which are reportedly set to bring in more than US100 billion over 11 seasons from 2023. With those negotiations now complete, and a pandemicdisrupted season now in the past, the NFL will be hoping that this year will be all about the football. For the first time ever, the league will have a 17game season in 2021 , a move which Goodell has hailed as a monumental moment in NFL history. The CBA with the players and the recently completed media agreements provide the foundation for us to enhance the quality of the NFL experience for our fans, Goodell said back in March.

This marked the first time a team has played the Super Bowl at their home field, as the Buccaneers reached the title game after winning three playoff games on the road. The league expanded its playoff system from a 12team to a 14team tournament, adding a third wild card team for each conference for the first time since the 2001 season , and only awarding each conference's division winner with the best record a first round bye. The Wild Card round was thus extended from two to three games per day. 1 The playoffs were played during the COVID19 pandemic in the United States , and each game's attendance was limited due to local health restrictions See also 2020 NFL season COVID19 restrictions . Had a serious outbreak occurred during the regular season, the league had contingency plans to delay the postseason, eliminate the bye week before the Super Bowl and postpone the game itself to as late as February 28. 2 3 NFL owners also approved an additional alternative plan to implement a 16team playoff format, with no teams getting a bye, if meaningful regular season games were canceled because of the virus. 4 The Cleveland Browns and eventual Super Bowl champions Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who had not made it to the playoffs since 2002 and 2007 , respectively, and thus held the two longest playoff appearance droughts in the league at the time, both qualified for the postseason in 2020, giving the New York Jets , who had not appeared since 2010 , the longest active playoff appearance drought. Conversely, the New England Patriots missed the postseason for the first time since 2008 , ending the longest playoff appearance streak in NFL history. With the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens facing each other in the AFC Divisional playoffs, Buffalo became the third team in NFL history joining the Los Angeles Rams and Philadelphia Eagles and the first AFC team to face every team within their respective conference in the postseason at least once.

Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Sign up Sign in Just how valuable is the NFL? Brendan Harding Follow 5 min read Sep 18, 2019 Listen Share Show of hands, how many of you watched any part of an NFL game this weekend? Better yet, how many discussed it with friends and family? OBJ scored in his first game back in New York, Antonio Brown caught a TD from TB12 in his first game for New England, 45 starting QBs were injured and will be out for long periods of time. I personally consider American football to be my 4th favorite sport baseball, hockey, and real football round out my top 3, yet there I sat on Sunday, laptop and TV showing different NFL games and following my two fantasy football leagues. Popular? You betcha. But, have you ever been curious as to just how profitable the NFL is? How it compares to other major sporting leagues worldwide? Other Fortune 500 companies? Lets take a look. First, below is a chart demonstrating the revenues for the top 6 sports leagues in the world As you can see, the National Football League is head and shoulders above the rest, nearly doubling its closest competitor in Major League Baseball. So, whats the breakdown of these profits? First, the NFL divides its revenue streams into national and local. Lets dive in National Revenue The first and most profitable stream of national revenue is TV deals. Forbes posted this great article detailing a 26 billion deal that was completed back in 2011. This deal gives companies like NBC, CBS, Fox, and ESPN the rights to their signature programs SNF, MNF , and various playoff gamesSuper Bowls. The reason these deals are astronomical in price is simple, the NFL is must see entertainment. Consider this since television became mainstream in the United States Im talking the 1960s folks, the NFL is responsible for 19 of the 20 highest viewed television programs. 19 of the top 20! This chart from Wikipedia puts this data on display perfectly. Im not sure its possible to fully wrap ones head around that fact of all the television programs ever brought to a television set the Seinfeld finale, Friends finale, The Office finale, every NBAMLBNHL game 7, think of how popular these are!, the National Football League has raked in the most viewers for 95 of the top 20 most watched programs. Absolutely astounding, pure domination in the entertainment industry. The other stream of revenue on a national level comes from licensing deals. Although this revenue stream may not come with the sexy statistics, it is important to note that the NFL is able to charge companies for putting its logo on their gear. For example, Nike and the NFL signed a deal with Fanatics in 2018 that made Fanatics or the Nike website the only place to buy official adultsized NFL jerseys. Not nearly as profitable as the TV deals, but interesting nonetheless. Local Revenue Local revenue streams are earned by the teams themselves, with the main stream of revenue being ticket and concession sales. Again, peanuts compared to the massive TV deals, but noteworthy regardless. As anyone who enjoys watching live sports has noticed, these ticket prices are nothing to scoff at. And dont get me started on the beers. Selling a Bud Light for 11.50 is a very easy way for an NFL owner to make 11.48. Thats why we sneak in fifths of Jack Daniels! Thats right NFL, if youre reading this, I have snuck in astronomical amounts of alcohol into your facilities. HA! As I wear my Patriots jersey and winter hat, and drink my Jack and Coke out of my Patriots travel mug, all of which I overpaid for. Shit, they always getcha. Another quick side note, NFL teams can utilize their stadiums for nonNFL events, like concerts and other gatherings. This local revenue is why teams like the Dallas Cowboys, New England Patriots, and Pittsburgh Steelers can earn more for their owners then the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Better product on the field leads to more fan support. More fan support leads to more tickets sold. More tickets sold leads to more beers consumed at 11.50 a pop, and so on. Certainly, jersey sales and TV deals do play a role in team by team net worth I have seen every Cowboys game on Fox since 1992, but my point remains local revenue streams can play a big role in team earnings. One last side note for those interested, according to the latest CBA Collective Bargaining Agreement, the ownerplayer profit split is around 5248. This means that for every 100 earned, 52 goes straight to the owners of the team and 48 goes to the players. Also keep in mind each team usually has 14 owners, while there are 52 players on a roster and a 10 man practice squad. Fair? Thats up for debate, but its the deal the players union signed. The NFL has done a fantastic job at dominating its market SportEntertainment. The advertising, the permeation of youth sports, the TV deals, we can argue about why it has dominated all day. The fact remains, football has become more than a sport to us. It is culture, especially in the Southern United States. Entire towns will shut down on Friday or Saturday to watch their local high school or college play. All of this being said, just how valuable is the NFL in the big scheme of things? How does it compare to the sharks of capitalist America? Lets take a look at its revenue compared to some Fortune 500 companies As the chart above demonstrates, the NFL isnt doing too shabby. More profitable than major insurance players like Unum and international brokerage firms like TD Ameritrade, but clearly less profitable than some major players in the business world Coca Cola and Nike. This chart does not include any of the top 75 Fortune 500 companies, listed here . If listed as a publicprivate company, the NFL would fall right around the 200. For reference, companies like Amazon, Walmart, Apple, and Exxon Mobile come in with yearly revenue in the 300 billion area. Theres a bit of perspective for you as well Walmart reported over 500 billion in revenue in 2018. Ridiculous numbers. There you have it, a brief rundown of the business side of Americas favorite sport. Next time you watch a game, keep a keen eye on all of the marketing and entertainment that goes into them. The endless commercials, the NFL logos everywhere, the selfpromotion for next weeks games, etc. You may start to see the game from a different angle as a targeted consumer more so than a hardcore fan. After all, youre paying big bucks for these guys to keep you entertained. Enjoy it. B.

Sports Central Original Sports Fan Commentary Since 1998 All Sports College Basketball College Football Golf MLB NBA NFL NHL Tennis Other Slant Pattern Foul Territory X RSS Feed Slant Pattern Foul Territory Sports Central Other Major Industries Sponsoring the NFL Major Industries Sponsoring the NFL The NFL is booming. After a banner season for the sport, with record viewing numbers and alltime high sponsorship revenue, the world's biggest brands are looking to secure deals to take advantage of the league's enviable global reach. The 2023 season ended with an enthralling 2522 victory for the Kansas City Chiefs, who became the first team for two decades to secure backtoback Super Bowls. The 2024 season promises to be just as memorable. NFL executive vice president Peter O'Reilly said The global interest in our game continues to grow rapidly, from fandom to participation, and the increase in international viewership underlines this. Figures show Super Bowl LVIII reached 210 million people domestically, and a further 62.5 million in global markets. The NFL is a juggernaut in terms of TV and sponsors, with the league comfortably clear of the NBA, NHL, and MLS. During the 2022 season, revenue from sponsorship jumped to a record 1.88bn, but which companies are buying most into North America's most marketable sports league? Technology Tech companies have a long affiliation with American football think of the now legendary commercial for the Apple Macintosh computer, which aired in 1984. Fastforward to the present day, and it's no surprise that four of the top 10 spending brands are in this industry. The world's most valuable company, Microsoft, was among a slew of tech corps that spent 395m in sponsorship in 2022. Apple also recently joined the roster again to advertise its music streaming platform, Apple Music. Foods and Beverages Tech, however, doesn't have the biggest sponsor. That accolade goes to PepsiCo, which spent more on rights than any other brand in 2022. Pepsi was the Super Bowl halftime sponsor for 10 years from 2012, before it was replaced by Apple Music, which penned a 50m a year deal. That didn't stop its investment, though. On the contrary, it just shifted its budget to a range of other NFL assets, including the increasingly popular NFL draft. Pepsi also has numerous lucrative deals with team franchises. Betting and Gaming The betting and gaming industry was second only to technology in sponsorships for the 2022 season, with a total value of 260m. That followed the NFL's firstever sportsbook partnerships, which drove a 12 spike in revenue for the league in 2021. American football fans regularly flock to casino sites to play casino games and bet on the biggest matchups during the regular and postseason. Experts expect this burgeoning sector will look to secure more sponsorships and team deals in the coming years. Telecoms Telecom companies were third on the top sponsors list in 2022, with 260m in revenue for the NFL. The industry had two of the top 10 individual sponsors that year Verizon third and Cisco eighth. Verizon started sponsoring the league back in 2010 when it first advertised its wireless, local and longdistance telecoms services. In 2023, it announced that it had agreed to a fiveyear deal with the NFL to deliver wireless solutions to all 30 stadiums to support onfield communication between coaches. Beer Beer companies were the third most lucrative sector for the NFL in 2022, with a value of 211m. This was spearheaded mainly by AnheuserBusch InBev. The BelgianBrazilian drink and brewing company, with brands including Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, was the secondhighest sponsor overall, only behind PepsiCo. AB InBev had a 34year run from 1989 as the exclusive beer sponsor for the Super Bowl, and it recently penned a partnership with the NFL worth 250m a year. Banking and Insurance In total, there were 30 leaguelevel sponsors during the 2023 season, but that only tells half the story. Brands also partner with individual franchises for stadium naming rights and other deals. IEG global managing director Peter Laatz, who helps to track sponsorships each year, notes When you do a leaguelevel deal, you are essentially buying the right to spend more money. You generally get access to ancillary events, but in terms of getting access to the actual game day action, you have to go to the clubs. Banking and insurance companies account for almost half of the sponsors for NFL naming rights, with industry giants including Bank of America BOA among those investing at club level. In 2023, BOA agreed to extend a longrunning partnership with the Carolina Panthers for the naming rights to its 74,867capacity venue. The deal highlights the scope of NFL assets and the opportunities big brands have to buy into America's favorite sport, and reach and engage with audiences attending and watching games across the country.

Advertisers all want to score a touchdown, but many will just settle for field goals. In other words, these advertisers may enjoy a surge in buzz on social media or a bump in YouTube views, but they will not be able to reach a level of performance that outweighs the cost of their investment . So, the question is How do advertisers score a touchdown? In marketing, brands must drive multiple metrics to be successful. Research shows that online and offline conversation, together, drive about 19 percent of purchases . Online conversations alone drive less than half of those purchases, essentially a field goal. This means that offline conversations are key to scoring a touchdown. Which brands enjoyed not only a surge in online buzz, but also a lift in offline conversation? One of the biggest winners in 2023 was ETrade with 350 percent lift in both offline and online conversations . ETrades advertisement featured the return of the iconic talking babies as adult investors, which drove discussion of this humorous content both in person and on social media. Pepsi Zero Sugar had huge success generating conversation , especially online. Pepsi Zero Sugars advertisements featured Steve Martin and Ben Stiller and asked consumers to engage with Pepsi and determine if the actors were real or acting. This clear call to action led to Pepsi Zero Sugars online social buzz lifting 3,000, coupled with an equally impressive offline lift of 300 percent. Another big winner was Heineken with around a 300 lift both offline and online conversation. The importance of this win is twofold Heineken made its mark airing the first national commercial in the Super Bowl for a nonalcoholic beer, plus 2023 marks the first time in decades that AnheuserBusch competitors could advertise nationally during the Super Bowl. Avocados From Mexico, Coors Light, Intuits TurboTax , Michelob Ultra, NFL, Planters and Tubi round out the top 10 list of brands making their mark in offline and online conversation. While we just explored brands winning in both the offline and online sense, there are other brands that were highly successful at driving online buzz through their Super Bowl ad, with a lower level of performance offline. These advertisers include Crown Royal, Bud Light , Doritos, Rakuten, TMobile, Dunkin and WeatherTech. For these Super Bowl advertisers who excelled at creating buzz online, there is an opportunity to evaluate marketing to give the brand a better chance at earning additional offline conversation. Our research shows that there are levers marketers can pull to improve performance across both channels. These include ensuring the advertising is strongly branded and includes a buzzworthy message that is easy to remember and talk about and has a call to action.

Fox Corp. sold at least 10 of the commercials that will appear in its Feb. 9 telecast of the NFL championship between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles for more than 8 million, according to two people familiar with the matter, a new record price for Super Bowl inventory that shows how much more important the event has become to Madison Avenue in the streaming era. The Super Bowl is the only place where you can aggregate legitimate scale with one commercial, says Mark Evans, executive vice president of sales at Fox Sports . Its not like any other thing. Related Stories VIP Super Bowl Ads Showcase Summer Movie Calendar With Minimal Competition China Box Office Hits Record 1.3 Billion Over Lunar New Year, Imax Also Scales New Highs Not too long ago, however, it was. By the end of last decade, the Super Bowl had hit a more fallow period where advertisers gained the upper hand, and the process of selling out all the ad inventory sometimes took until just days before kickoff. The NFL had increased regularseason inventory by securing deals for CBS, then NBC to air Thursday Night Football, meaning that advertisers had a glut of cheaper commercial time during the NFL regular season at the ready, and could run commercials more frequently for a smaller outlay of cash. Popular on Variety Now that streaming is reworking the economics of traditional TV, says Evans, there are just fewer places for big and small marketers alike to find big audiences all watching content at the same time. A chunk of TV advertisers are taking money they once would have invested in primetime shows on cable, and even some on broadcast, says Evans, and moving that money into sports. The NFL has benefitted from that, he says. Fox, which started out seeking around 7 million for 30 seconds of Super Bowl ad time, had disposed of the bulk of its Super Bowl LIX inventory in August . Still, demand continued even after Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch announced during the companys third quarter investor call that all ads had sold out. Indeed, the recent California wildfires prompted a group of sponsors including State Farm Insurance to ask to be released from their deals, according to the person familiar with the matter, and Fox was able to resell their time for higher prices thanks to intense interest. Some of that activity may have spurred a portion of the hefty 8 millionplus pacts. Even ads around the Super Bowl telecast have gotten more expensive. Thirty seconds of ad time in Foxs late pregame coverage have gone for as much as 4.5 million, according to one of the people familiar with the matter, comparted with 2 million in the past. A 30second ad in Foxs postgame coverage might go for around 4 million, this person says, compared with between 2.5 million and 3 million in the past. Foxs last Super Bowl telecast, in 2023, generated around 600 million in total ad revenue tied to the main event and ancillary programming. Fox will be able to squeeze some extra commercials into the main event. The NFL, which has final say on the number of commercial breaks and ads in the Super Bowl, agreed to let the network add what is believed to be more than five spots as part of floating breaks that might surface after a time out or if a player is injured, or after an unexpected stop to game play. Fox and the NFL would share revenue from those commercials, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. The commercials show up in what the NFL calls flex pods, says Mike North, the leagues vice president of broadcast planning. These breaks were created to stop toofrequent interruptions to game play, he says. The concept lets you take advantage of downtime. If youre lucky, you get to the fourth quarter and maybe eight minutes in the late game and the only break is if its the twominute warning, he says. Now we can just play football, and let the game continue with rapidfire action and excitement. Among the advertisers that have announced their presence in the 2025 game are AnheuserBusch InBev, PepsiCo, Ferrara Candy Co.s Nerds, GeorgiaPacifics Angel Soft, Squarespace and Stellantis. Viewers can expect to see noticeably fewer automakers come out this year, says Foxs Evans, and potentially fewer movie studios and streamers. Foxs good fortune with the Super Bowl may continue. NBCUniversal is slated to broadcast the event in 2026 and is likely to try to create packages that include the football spectacular, the Winter Olympics and the NBA AllStar Game. I dont see it slowing down anytime soon, Evans says.

The brands' logos were among those that scored millions of dollars in media exposure during Super Bowl 56, according to the data. Software company Hive has measured the last four Super Bowls and provided CNBC a copy of its report hours after the game. In this article HIVEV Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Von Miller 40 of the Los Angeles Rams holds up the Vince Lombardi Trophy after Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium on February 13, 2022 in Inglewood, California. The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 2320. Rob Carr Getty Images The Los Angeles Rams won their second Super Bowl in franchise history, beating the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. But NFL sponsors Nike, Pepsi and Bose also came out on top, according to an early version of ingame media valuations seen by CNBC. These brands' logos were among those that scored millions of dollars in media exposure during Super Bowl 56, according to data compiled by San Franciscobased software company Hive in collaboration with sports consultancy firm Elevate . Sponsor brands received 170 million of ingame exposure, according to the report, up slightly from 169 million during the 2021 Super Bowl. The 2020 game generated 143 million. Hive said brands received more than 75 minutes of onscreen time during Super Bowl 56. That's down from 104 minutes in 2021, in part due to the lifting of pandemic restrictions for this year's game. This is the fourth consecutive year the software company has used its artificial intelligence platform to track media sponsorships during the big game. With incontent exposure gaining traction among sports leagues looking to drive revenue , the companydeveloped Mensio software provides brandexposure data beyond traditional commercials for live sporting events. Nielsen has been the currency for measuring traditional commercials, Hive president Dan Calpin told CNBC. We see ourselves as the gold standard for measuring incontent brand exposure for which there is no currency today. Los Angeles Rams' Cooper Kupp scores a touchdown. Mike Segar Reuters Increasing ingame value Hive's 2022 report combined visual and verbal exposures throughout Super Bowl 56. Nike scored 46 minutes of onscreen time, while Bose, one of the National Football League's top sideline sponsors, had its brand logo appear for eight minutes Pepsi had double exposure with its brands, according to Hive's data. The beverage maker sponsored the halftime show perhaps for the last time featuring iconic hiphop stars Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Hive estimated Pepsi's combined brands, including Gatorade, were on the screen for roughly nine minutes and its brand was mentioned a gamehigh 11 times. LR Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg perform during the Pepsi Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show at SoFi Stadium on February 13, 2022 in Inglewood, California. Kevin C. Cox Getty Images Toyota , Verizon , and New Era followed with a combined three minutes one minute each of ingame exposure. And SoFi , which agreed to a 625 million naming rights deal with the Rams, had roughly one minute of ingame exposure that Hive valued at 3.5 million. There is so much focus and watercooler conversation on the commercials, but when you step back, the most exposed brands might not have aired a commercial, and people were exposed to them in some cases for several minutes during the game, Calpin said. That means people are making positive associations with Nike, Gatorade, SoFi and Pepsi, even though they are not buying traditional commercials, he added. Mensio, which was developed in 2018, records every second of televised content it also tracks logo exposure in postgame highlights and social media videos. To establish valuation, Calpin said Hive uses metrics like duration, and the quality and size of a brand's logo on the screen in its calculations. Throughout the 2022 Super Bowl, Hive detected company logos on jerseys, bottles, coolers, towels, tablets, carts, headphones and instadiumarena signage. Calpin said every 150 seconds of average ingame exposure is equivalent to the value of a 30second commercial. NBC charged roughly 6.5 million for Super Bowl 56 commercials, and some brands paid a recordhigh 7 million for a 30second ad. Game revenue is expected to surpass the 545 million total that ViacomCBS generated last year. Those commercial ratings only tell part of the story, Calpin said. They measure the viewership of traditional ads 15 and 30 seconds but ignore the brands that were exposed within the content itself. A changing landscape Hive provided its Super Bowl data to Elevate to verify valuation estimations. Elevate is run by San Francisco 49ers president Al Guido. Thomas Bernstein, executive vice president of insights at Elevate, said Hive's data helps companies get a better return on objectives and their return on investment and turn data into insights, into sales and partnerships. Hive is valued at 2 billion, according to PitchBook. Some of its revenue comes from licensing software to companies including Disney , Walmart , and top NFL sponsor AnheuserBusch . Hive also has agreements with mediameasurement companies Comscore and Octagon, and advertising firm Interpublic Group of Companies , known as IPG. With Nielsen's No. 1 TVmeasurement status in jeopardy, Calpin said Hive wants to be the industryaccepted leader when it comes to incontent measurement. The National Basketball Association introduced the nontraditional advertising jersey patch program in 2017. That asset shows a company's logo on NBA uniforms during games. The league also is at the beginning stages of its virtual floor ads, displayed on the court throughout NBA games. Similarly, Major League Baseball also plans to leverage virtual ads throughout games, and the National Hockey League has launched its helmet and jersey patch assets. Tech companies like Apple are also leveraging incontent exposure. For example, Apple features its products in entertainment shows, including Ted Lasso, which streams on Apple TV. As video viewership continues to shift to no or lowad platforms like Netflix and HBO Max, the relative importance on branded content will continue to increase, Calpin said. Viewership metrics for the 2022 Super Bowl should be available this week, and that'll provide additional media value around the game. PredictHQ, a demandintelligence company, projected the game would reach 117 million viewers , which would be a record high.

This asset proved to be extremely profitable due to the implementation of LED signage and being able to rotate sponsors throughout the quarter. It allowed for a particular sponsor to own a moment and be featured on social highlights and clips of key plays throughout the game. Pepsi rose to the top of the list due to being the halftime presenting partner while still maintaining instadium assets. With the help of the Weeknd, viewers were excited and encouraged to remain glued to the TV to watch his performance. The NFL did an excellent job of utilizing broadcast graphics and background signage, increasing the Pepsi exposures and time on screen.

Read more Largest alltime Super Bowl advertisers 2021 Published by Michele Majidi , May 22, 2023 Budweiser was the company that has spent the most on Super Bowl advertising as of January 2021, doling out a total of 470.5 million U.S. dollars on Super Bowl commercials since the first Super Bowl in 1967. Pepsi followed with a total spend of 320.36 million dollars, while CocaCola came in third with 202.44 million. All three companies have long been Super Bowl fixtures, producing ads that have become firmly entrenched in American pop culture, such as CocaCola's 1980 Hey Kid, Catch!, which went on to become the subject of caricatures on TV series and was parodied by CocaCola itself in 2009. Both Budweiser's parent company AnheuserBusch and PepsiCo are among the NFL's largest sponsors, with Bud Light serving as the NFL's official beer, and Pepsi sponsoring the big game's halftime show since 2012. Amid the impact of the COVID19 pandemic, Budweiser, Pepsi, and CocaCola announced they would not air ads during Super Bowl LV in 2021, but were expected to make a return in 2022.

The multiyear partnership was announced Friday and financial terms werent disclosed. In a statement, the NFL said that it couldnt think of a more appropriate partner for the show. The halftime show is mostwatched musical performance of the year, with 120 million people watching this years performance. Apple Musics sponsorship begins at the next Super Bowl on February 12, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona. More details about the show, including performers, will be released in the coming months on Apple Musics social platforms. Pepsi PEP has been the NFLs halftime show sponsor for the past decade. However, it announced in May that it was ending its halftime show sponsorship, however it still remains the leagues official soft drink after a 10year deal struck last May. Pepsi isnt the only beverage brand dialing back its presence at the big game. AnheuserBusch announced earlier this year that it ended its morethan33yearold exclusive deal with the Super Bowl, allowing other alcohol brands to jump in. For example, Molson Coors TAP quickly purchased a 30second spot. The Super Bowl routinely gets more than 100 million viewers in the United States, a gold mine for advertisers. Variety recently reported that Fox, which is airing next years game, is nearly sold out of commercial inventory, with several spots going for north of 7 million.

The National Football Conference NFC champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the defending American Football Conference AFC and Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs , 319. 7 The game was played on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida , the home stadium of the Buccaneers, marking the first time a team played a Super Bowl in its home stadium. 8 9 10 Due to COVID19 protocols limiting the stadium's seating capacity to 25,000 fans, 11 Super Bowl LV was the leastattended postmerger championship game. However, it and the 1941 NFL Championship Game with 13,341 attendees due to World War II restrictions are declared restrictedattendance events, and ignored for league records. citation needed The lowest unrestricted NFL championship game attendance was in December 1935 , when 15,000 spectators attended. The Buccaneers' victory was their second and made them one of two teams, along with the Baltimore Ravens , to be undefeated in multiple Super Bowls. They finished the regular season with an 115 record and a wild card berth to advance to their second Super Bowl appearance through the guidance of several new acquisitions, most notably 21year veteran quarterback Tom Brady in his first season away from the New England Patriots . The Chiefs, aided by their topranked offense, finished the regular season with a leaguebest 142 record to advance to their fourth Super Bowl appearance and were the defending Super Bowl LIV champions, seeking to become the first repeat champions since the Patriots in 2004 . 12 For the first time under quarterback Patrick Mahomes , the Chiefs failed to score a touchdown and lost by doubledigits, making them the third Super Bowl team not to score a touchdown. c 13 They also committed 11 penalties for 120 yards, including a record eight penalties for 95 yards in the first half, most of which were called against the defense. 14 15 16 17 The Buccaneers capitalized on these struggles to take a commanding 216 lead at halftime and dominated the remainder of the game. Brady, who also extended his player records for Super Bowl appearances to ten and wins to seven, was named Super Bowl MVP for a record fifth time and was the first to receive the award with multiple franchises. 18 19 20 He became the oldest player to receive the honor and win a Super Bowl as the starting quarterback at age 43, 21 breaking additional personal records, while Bruce Arians was the oldest head coach to win the Super Bowl at 68. 22 The game was televised nationally by CBS . Country music singer Eric Church and RB singer Jazmine Sullivan performed the national anthem , while the halftime show was headlined by Canadian singer the Weeknd . 5 On television, Super Bowl LV was seen by 91.63 million viewers, the lowest ratings for the game since 2006.

I am a Professor looking for deep insights into marketing Follow Author Feb 08, 2021, 0721pm EST Save Article This article is more than 4 years old. While Tom Brady was winning his 7th Super Bowl, viewers were treated to several good ads Photo by ... Eva Marie Uzcategui TrinklAnadolu Agency via Getty Images Anadolu Agency via Getty Images The appeals used in the 2021 Super Bowl were clearly influenced by the pandemic, with a majority of the ads using lighter approaches . In conjunction with the use of humor, we saw heavier doses than usual of celebrities, popular songs, and appeals to familiar aspects of life. Overall, this approach seemed to work for many advertisers. Data from a consumer study by the Angus Reid Group conducted after the game shows that the ads were generally well received, and that no individual commercial was listed as the most disliked by more than 5 of survey respondents. Further, according to social media analytics company Sprout Social , 2021 saw a 41 increase in Twitter mentions of Super Bowl ads more than 5.5 million in raw numbers, with 53 of those mentions being positive, 30 neutral, and just 17 negative. Again, this is indicative of an average ad hitting the mark. While it would seem that more advertisers using similar approaches might make it more difficult for an ad to stand out, a forthcoming paper in the Journal of Advertising that I worked on with Alexander Mafael Stockholm School of Economics, Sascha Raithel Freie University of Berlin, and David Stewart Loyola Marymount University finds that it is the uniqueness of ads as measured by the use of numerous creative variables compared to as from prior years , as opposed to the current year, that is a driver of effectiveness. Additionally, the study found consistency with the brands previous advertising message to be correlated with success, especially when combined with uniqueness compared to other advertisers Super Bowl ads from prior years. The choice of the very best ads is a bit more difficult than usual as several ads scored quite well, without many outliers. In composing the list, I considered my own opinion, Advertising Ages expert panel ratings , Angus Reids survey results, USA Todays Admeter likeability ratings, and the Kellogg School of Managements annual ADPLAN ratings from the programs MBA students. So here are the ratings, in reverse order 5 State Farm Drake from State Farm In a product category loaded with effective advertising and effective trade characters Think Flo, Mayhem, and the Gekko, Jake from State Farm has been used effectively to emphasize the companys agents being neighborly and providing good service. Patrick Mahomes and Aaron Rodgers have added star power to the campaign, while effectively emphasizing that everyone is treated the same. In this years Super Bowl ad, Rodgers and Mahomes are initially annoyed that their standins for filming the commercial do not look like them. Next, Drake introduces himself as Jakes standin and starts reciting the brands Like a Good Neighbor slogan. Jake, apparently feeling threatened by the all too cool Drake interrupts and says that standins do not have lines and then sings the jingle. Attention grabbing, funny, and reinforces the good neighbor theme. The ad placed 3rd with Angus Reids panel and 8th with Admeter, while receiving a B from Kellogg. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best HighYield Savings Accounts Of September 2023 By Kevin Payne , Contributor Best 5 Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023 By Cassidy Horton , Contributor 4 Indeed The Rising One of a relatively few ads to use an emotional appeal, job search site Indeed scored with this beautifully creative ad showing scenes of jobseekers from all walks of life and treating the topic in an empathetic manner with Rise Up as the background music. While this was rated higher by experts 5 stars by Ad Age and an A from the Kellogg School compared to 26 by USA Today it hammers home a message of empowerment and is truly touching. 3 Amazon Alexas Body As Ad Age, which gave the ad 3.5 stars out of five, notes this spot may be a little unrealistic given that Alexa is an inanimate object, but the successful use of a sexual appeal here is notable. In a paper I published with my coauthors in the Journal of Consumer Affairs, we found that sexual appeals have gone almost extinct in Super Bowl ads over the past 10 year s. The use of Michael B. Jordan as the object of the female lead characters desires, much to her husbands chagrin is a clever twist on this type of appeal. No doubt, the humor in the ad softened the overtness sexual appeal, and it appears to have worked. The ad score 3 on Admeter, was rated an A with Kellogg, and was tied for 9th in being mentioned as the viewers favorite ad by Angus Reid. 2 Jeep The Middle It came on after the outcome of the game seemed to already be decided but this 2minutelong ads stunning visuals and production values are attention grabbing. Starring the previously ad resistant Bruce Springsteen and set in the geographic center of the continental United States, the ad delivers a message of unity, referring to finding the middle and the Reunited States of America. Building on Jeep Chryslers tradition of focusing on larger societal messages with celebrity spokespeople Clint Eastwood, Oprah Winfrey, Bob Dylan, Paul Harvey, and Eminem, this is a badly needed message. While not without some controversy on both sides due to Springsteens prior political activism, the ad scored well on Admeter at 12, was 6th for Angus Reid and received a rave fivestar review from Ad Age, but only a C from the Kellogg MBAs. Kudos to The Boss for the courage to film this ad and to Jeep as well. 1 Cheetos It Wasnt Me This ad typified this years ad in multiple ways. Star studded, with Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, and Shaggy in featured roles, the ad uses light humor and a song parody to demonstrate how tempting Cheetos are and display the trademark orange gunk as Kunis gets caught cheating by eating the Cheetos. Kutchers offkey singing lends a selfdeprecating air to the ad that is endearing and funny. The ad was 1 for the Angus Reid panel, 7 for USA Today, received an A from the Kellogg school and 3.5 stars from Ad Age. Honorable mention Rocket Mortgages two ads featuring Tracy Morgan emphasizing that Certain is Better when mortgaging a house, Cadillacs Edgar Scissorhands, and Toyotas Jessica Long Upstream which focused on the Paralympians life were also strong ads that scored with many reviewers. Both Reddits clever 5 second ad and Oatlys controversial Wow, No Cow were also highly effective in generating buzz on social media and deserve mention. Oatlys case is particularly interesting as this very odd ad originally filmed in Sweden featuring the companys CEO signing was largely disliked by consumers and could be a candidate for worst lists stay tuned..... However, the company apparently expected this and was willing to accept the dislike in exchange for higher awareness of its plantbased milk even distributing tshirts that refer to not liking the ad. All in all though, more ads played it safe this year, and achieved mostly safe results. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Check out my website . Editorial Standards Forbes Accolades

While the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs duked it out for the Lombardi Trophy with Tom Brady emerging victorious advertisers competed for the coveted title of best Super Bowl commercial. Of course, the ad slots came at a premium, running a reported 5.5 million for a 30second spot in 2020. ADVERTISEMENT Which ads were worth the investment? In no particular order, here are 15 of the best commercials money could buy, including extended looks at the spots. General Motors No Way, Norway Apparently, Norway sells the most electric vehicles per capita ... and Will Ferrell isn't pleased about that news. The Saturday Night Live legend enlists the help of Kenan Thompson and Awkwafina to send Norway a message, and hilarity ensues. Uber Eats Wayne's World Cardi B's Shameless Manipulation Sticking with the SNL vibe, Mike Myers and Dana Carvey reprise their roles as Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar, respectively, with an assist from Cardi B in this spot from Uber Eats. The extended cut redefines the word extended, clocking in at more than twoandahalf hours as local Uber Eatsaffiliated restaurants scroll by. Meanwhile, Wayne and Garth hang out in the background, causing a ruckus. Cadillac LYRIQ ScissorHandsFree It turns out that 1990's Edward Scissorhands had an alternate ending in which Edward and Kim Boggs, played by Winona Ryder, get together and have a son of their own Edgar, played by Timothe Chalamet. Edgar experiences hardships similar to what his father went through in the movie, but times have changed between then and now cars included! Amazon Alexa's Body Amazon's flagship smart device, Alexa, has a sleek, new look. But could it be even easier on the eyes? Well, the answer is yes if Michael B. Jordan could house Amazon's software. The idea is purely fantasy in 2021 ... but hey, never say never. Michelob Ultra Organic Seltzer AllStar Cast Can you spot real from fake? Michelob Ultra plays the lookalike game with Don Cheadle, Megan Fox, Serena Williams, Sylvester Stallone and a host of other celebrities or are they? playing a part. The adult beverage at the center of it all is Michelob Ultra's Organic Seltzer, which is as real as it tastes, according to Cheadle. There's another surprise reveal at the end of the commercial to leave you questioning all you hold dear. MM's Come Together Apologies are sweet, but an apologies with candy are sweeter. MM's pairs with Schitt's Creek star Dan Levy to send home this tasty message. Jeep The Middle Who better than The Boss, Bruce Springsteen, to be a voice calling for unification? Set in Lebanon, Kansas, at a chapel that, according to Springsteen, stands at the exact center of the lower 48, Springsteen calls for people to meet in the middle. This is one of the few politically inclined ads in this year's Super Bowl slate, and it packs a powerful message. Bud Light Legends The Bud Light has gone missing, but some familiar faces are on the case, including Post Malone and Cedric the Entertainer. A bevy of other icons from Bud Light commercials past and present hello, Bud Knight! rally to fix the issue. Is there anything smarter than saving the day? Probably not, if you're asking the Real Men of Genius singer. Indeed The Rising Not all commercials went the celebritycomedy route. Case in point Indeed's ad called The Rising. With a cover of Andra Day's Rise Up providing the backdrop, the spot hits the heartstrings during an uncertain time in the employment market. Tide The Jason Alexander Hoodie Tide answers the question you didn't think anybody asked What if my hoodie with Jason Alexander's face on it could react to various conditions of cleanliness? Turns out, in classic Alexander fashion, the hoodie with his face isn't too thrilled about getting messy. Good thing Tide is there to make it good as new! For the Seinfeld diehards, the soundtrack of the Greatest American Hero theme song serves as a fun callback to George Costanza's answering machine. Toyota Upstream In the category of who's cutting onions in here? Super Bowl ads, we have Toyota's 2021 spot. This commercial shares the inspiring story of Jessica Long, a Paralympic gold medalist who was adopted from Russia at 13 months old and, because of a rare condition, had her lower legs amputated at 18 months old. Long has won 23 Paralympic medals in swimming, including 13 gold. Toyota is a sponsor of Team USA Olympians and Paralympians. Cheetos It Wasn't Me Quarantine put a lot of relationships into a pressure cooker, and celebrities weren't immune. Hollywood supercouple Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher put that on display in a Cheetos ad in which Kunis is spotted munching Kutcher's Cheetos Crunch Pop Mix. That's where musician Shaggy comes in, suggesting Kunis use his excuse from 2000's hit It Wasn't Me as her defense. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, including orange fingers and lips, the gambit apparently works! Verizon Can't Blame The Lag A CGI Samuel L. Jackson yelling at video game characters, including a cuddly bear that happens to be carrying a spiked mace? Sold! Keep an eye out for Pittsburgh Steelers wideout Juju SmithSchuster making a cameo. Rocket Mortgage Certain Is Better Leave it to Tracy Morgan to illuminate the difference between being pretty sure and being certain. Between jumping out of an airplane with something you're pretty sure is a parachute and being pretty sure you could take down Dave Bautista, Rocket Mortgage goes to great lengths to show how it important it is to be certain when it comes to buying a house. AnheuserBusch Let's Grab A Beer It's difficult to change someone's mood in four words, but this spot for AnheuserBusch reminds folks that it isn't impossible. In this ad, the words Let's grab a beer do indeed mean that, but they also represent much more, depending on the context.

No, not that little football game between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams. Its the soft drink showdown Coke vs. Pepsi. Pepsi is one of Super Bowl 53s biggest sponsors, and faster than you can say bless your heart the company swarmed Atlanta, the home of CocaCola, with over 350 ads on billboards, recycling bins and even the walls of train stations. Pepsi Super Bowl ads surround CocaCola vending machines in Atlanta, GA. Nicole SaidiCNN The ads are not only huge, theyre snarky too. One billboard right down the street from The World of CocaCola museum reads Pepsi in Atlanta. How Refreshing. Another displays the phrase Hey Atlanta, Thanks For Hosting. Well Bring The Drinks. The promotion is a big spend for us, said Greg Lyons, chief marketing officer for Pepsi Beverages North America. We are absolutely leaning in to make sure that we are painting Atlanta blue during the Super Bowl. Pepsi ads blanket Atlanta's downtown MARTA station. Delaney StrunkCNN Despite the blue wave, CocaCola proved it knows a thing or two about being a good Southern hostess welcoming Pepsis presence in Atlanta. As Atlantas hometown beverage company for more than 130 years, were thrilled to help our city welcome everyone to town for the Big Game, including our friends from Pepsi, CocaCola told CNN. The brands have a long rivalry The soft drink brands have been rivals for decades, throwing jabs at each other with videos like Pepsis blind taste test commercial which first ran in the 1970s. The rivalry started to fade as PepsiCo focused on its merger with FritoLay, and CocaCola relaunched its Diet Coke line. While both companies have expanded their product line to include teas, water and energy drinks, Coke is still winning the cola war. In the last decade, Coke has seen a .5 rise in its market share , while Pepsis dropped 1.9, according to Beverage Digest. Pepsi billboards surround Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park, just miles away from CocaCola's Headquarters and museum. Katherine Dorsett BennettCNN This is how Coke responded Although Pepsi stepped all over Cokes turf, CocaCola plans to use its Super Bowl commercial to celebrate unity. The companys A Coke is a Coke ad, which will air right before the National Anthem, drives home the message that people joining together is beautiful. The CocaCola Foundation also announced a 1 million donation to Atlantas National Center for Civil and Human Rights, which will allow the museum to provide free admission from January 28 through the end of February.

Subscribe To Newsletters 2019 Super Bowl Ads Were Viewed Massively Online Before And After The Game By Nelson Granados Follow Save Article Business Hollywood Entertainment 2019 Super Bowl Ads Were Viewed Massively Online Before And After The Game By Nelson Granados , Contributor. I cover digital trends in travel, media and entertainment. Follow Author Feb 08, 2019, 0119pm EST Save Article This article is more than 6 years old. New England Patriots' Kyle Van Noy 53 sacks Los Angeles Rams' Jared Goff 16 during the second ... half of the NFL Super Bowl 53 football game Sunday, Feb. 3, 2019, in Atlanta. AP PhotoMark Humphrey Super Bowl ad space is one of the most coveted for advertisers, who paid around 5.25 million to CBS for a 30second spot on Super Bowl 2019, an increase of 60 from what it cost in 2008. You would think that with the advent of digital streaming services, which provide many viewing alternatives for those who are not football fans, and given reported declines in NFL viewership in the last couple years, demand and hence the cost of a Super Bowl ad would go down. So why do Super Bowl ad spots keep going up in price? One of the reasons could be that social media fuels the viral effect as consumers watch and share their favorite Super Bowl ads. So rather than digital platforms deterring Super Bowl viewership and therefore ad views, they may be a powerful complement. Pex , a company that delivers video and music analytics and rights management services, tracked views of 28 Super Bowl ads before, during, and after Super Bowl Sunday on 24 video and social media platforms, including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. Ads tracked include Amazon, Pepsi, Toyota, Old Spice, Budweiser, Stella Artois, Pepsi, and Doritos, among others. The results show that despite a snoozing Super Bowl that led to a low televised audience around 98.2 million viewers, ads were watched massively online before and after the game. On Thursday and Friday before the Super Bowl, the 28 ads tracked had already been viewed about 105 million times across the original YouTube ads and more than 1,000 videos, including on the brands own accounts, organic reuploads, and preroll views ads that play before a YouTube video, for example. 65 of the reuploads included the full commercial. Clearly, some advertisers could have started their Super Bowl party as early as Friday night, had they been aware of these numbers and the corresponding early success of their campaigns. Daily views of Super Bowl ads on 24 digital platforms including YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and ... Twitter. PEX Interestingly, on Saturday alone, viewership of these ads on digital platforms tapered off to less then 30 million. Was it the rush to get ready for the big day, with shopping, kids sports, errands, keeping fans away from the screens? Possibly. On Sunday, as would be expected, views of the ads went up again to about 45 million, as the graph above shows. Then, notice the very interesting spike on Monday, probably as Super Bowl fans searched to see their favorite ads again, and as the viral effect of popular ads in social media platforms went into effect. On Tuesday, viewership went back to average preSunday levels, and then on Wednesday and Thursday the ad fever subsided, for the most part. According to PEX, by Friday morning the top ads in online views across the 24 platforms before, during, and after the Super Bowl were Amazon 45.9 million views on 108 copies Pepsi 36.8 million views on 812 copies Lexus 25.1 million views on 28 copies These revealing numbers of digital views of Super Bowl ads show the complementary nature of traditional and digital media for advertisers. For the Amazon ad, that's almost 50 more viewership when you add online views. Ad viewership numbers for the Super Bowl magnify the increasingly social phenomenon of content consumption. The bang for the buck when advertisers invest in commercials is no longer just driven by TV broadcast viewership, but is also reflected in the potential viral effect in digital channels, fueled by social media. After all, content consumption is social. The power of TV broadcast for mass consumption, coupled with shares and likes in digital platforms, increasingly make mass media and social media a powerful combination for advertisers.

GlobalData Analytics and visualisation solutions has contributed positively when preparing management presentations and strategic papers. Business Intelligence Marketing Manager, SAL Heavy Lift COVID19 has caused significant interference to our business and the COVID19 intelligence from GlobalData has helped us reach better decisions around strategy. These two highlights have helped enormously to understand the projections into the future concerning our business units, we also utilise the project database to source new projects for LiebherrWerk to use as an additional source to pitch for new business. Market Analyst Management, LiebherrWerk Your daily news has saved me a lot of time and keeps me uptodate with what is happening in the market, I like that you almost always have a link to the source origin. We also use your market data in our Strategic Business Process to support our business decisions. By having everything in one place on the Intelligence Center it has saved me a lot of time versus looking on different sources, the alert function also helps with this. Head of Key Accounts, Saab AB Having used several other market research companies, I find that GlobalData manages to provide that difficulttoget market data that others cant, as well as very diverse and complete consumer surveys. Marketing Intelligence Manager, Portugal Foods Our experience with GlobalData has been very good, from the platform itself to the people. I find that the analysts and the account team have a high level of customer focus and responsiveness and therefore I can always rely on. The platform is more holistic than other providers. It is convenient and almost like a one stop shop. The pricing suite is highly competitive and value for our organisation. I like reports that inform new segments such as the analysis on generation Z, millennials, the impact of COVID 19 to our banking customers and their new channel habits. Secondly the specialist insight on affluent sector significantly increases our understanding about this group of customers. The combination of those give us depth and breadth of the evolving market. Im in the business of answering and helping people make decisions so with the intelligence center I can do that, effectively and efficiently. I can share quickly key insights that answer and satisfy our country stakeholders by giving them many quality studies and primary research about competitive landscape beyond the outlook of our bank. It helps me be seen as an advisory partner and that makes a big difference. A big benefit of our subscription is that no one holds the whole data and because it allows so many people, so many different parts of our organisation have access, it enables all teams to have the same level of knowledge and decision support. Head of Customer Insight and Research, Standard Chartered I know that I can always rely on Globaldatas work when Im searching for the right consumer and market insights. I use Globaldata insights to understand the changing market consumer landscape and help create better taste wellbeing solutions for our customers in food, beverage and healthcare industries. Globaldata has the right data and the reports are of very high quality compared to your competitors.

The reports and data dashboards help engagement with clients they provide valuable industry and market insights that can enrich client conversations and can help in the shaping of value propositions. Moreover, using GlobalData products has helped increase my knowledge of the finance sector, the players within it, and the general threats and opportunities. I find the consumer surveys that are carried out to be extremely beneficial and not something I have seen anywhere else. They provided an insightful view of why and which consumers take or dont particular financial products. This can help shape conversations with clients to ensure they make the right strategic decisions for their business. One of the challenges I have found is that data in the payments space is often piecemeal. With GD all of the data I need is in one place, but it also comes with additional market reports that provide useful extra context and information. Having the ability to setup alerts on relevant movements in the industry, be it competitors or customers, and have them emailed directly to me, ensures I get early sight of industry activity and dont have to search for news.

We all know this is THE broadcast event of the year, capturing the eyes of millions, which means brand visibility can translate into substantial value well into the millions. At the epicenter of televised advertising, Apple Music and Gatorade emerged as the ultimate victors in the battleground of broadcast value during Super Bowl LVII . Their strategic placements within the game's framework paid off immensely, with Apple Music reaping the rewards through innovative Halftime Broadcast Graphics, resulting in an impressive 60 average MVP viewability score. DOWNLOAD THE SUPER BOWL LVII REPORT Gatorade's brilliant Sideline Setup, featuring the iconic coolers at the center of the bench, dominated the brand exposure by accounting for 41 of their total visibility throughout the game. This wasn't just a lucky break it was the fruit of thoughtful marketing strategies that understand the power of prominent, repetitive branding during highprofile sports events. Aside from these giants, 13 additional sponsors also enjoyed the limelight, collectively earning a staggering 14.5M in SMV Social Media Value, making up 19 of the overall branding value pie of this grand sporting spectacle. These included prominent names like AWS, DraftKings, Pepsi, and Google, among others. Yet, amidst this branding fiesta, a noticeable change was the absence of the typically prominent coaches' headsets. Previous seasons saw Bose generating a massive 38.9M in SMV from these small but frequently captured items. This year, the absence of Bose left a gap in the branding strategy, underscoring the impact even the most subtle product placements can have when viewed through the lens of televised sports' greatest stages. As brands evolve their advertising approaches, the message is clear visibility in the right moment can yield extraordinary value, and Super Bowl LVII was a masterclass in strategic brand placement.

Despite breaking up the European football season and being clouded by controversy from the getgo, it will likely be a spectacle once again and followed by billions around the world. A look at several business aspects of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, from sponsors to prize money and cost and from attendance figures to stadiums. Who sponsors the FIFA World Cup 2022? FIFA has several sponsorship tiers. There are FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and Regional Sponsors. The governing body is currently implementing a new format with four tiers . By unbundling the womens and esports branch from the mens branch, FIFA hopes to increase overall sponsorship income. German sportswear manufacturer Adidas is a FIFA Partner FIFA Partners Currently there are seven FIFA Partners, who have global rights and can use FIFAs branding during all tournaments and across all branches Adidas sportswear Coca Cola beverage Wanda Group conglomerate HyundaiKia Motors automotive Qatar Airways airline QatarEnergy oil gas Visa financial services FIFA World Cup Sponsors The second tier consist of World Cup Sponsors. These companies have global rights as well but are restricted to the World Cup tournament in the buildup and during. FIFA has seven World Cup Sponsors Budweiser alcoholic beverage and part of AnheuserBusch InBev Byjus educational technology Crypto.com cryptocurrency platform Hisense electronics home appliances McDonalds restaurants real estate Mengniu Dairy dairy products Vivo consumer electronics In the current setup FIFA has six to eight slots for both FIFA Partners and World Cup Sponsors. In the future there is an extra tier between these two that gives rights to all tournaments in a certain branch the mens, womens or esports. Regional Supporters The 2022 FIFA World Cup also has Regional Sponsors. The companies have the same tournament rights but are restricted to one or more of the five regions. FIFA has a maximum of four companies per region. GWC supply chain solutions Africa Middle East Ooredoo telecommunications Africa Middle East QNB Group financial services Africa Middle East The Look Company visual engagement solutions North Central America FritoLay snack food North Central America Algorand blockchain North America Europe Claro telecommunications South America Nubank financial services South America UPL OpenAg agrochemical South America 4,666 million of revenue budgeted for 2022 World Cup year The FIFA World Cup is the governing bodys flagship tournament that drives income. The total revenue budgeted for 2022 World Cup year is 4,666 million. The amount is made up of five main revenue categories. The sale of television broadcasting rights contributes the most with 56 percent of the total income and amounts to 2,640 million. Sponsorship income marketing rights comes second with 1,353 million and contributes for 29 percent. Hospitality rights and ticket sales, licensing rights and other revenue and income amount to 673 million. The total investment, in other words cost, budgeted for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar is 1,696 million. A decrease compared to the 1,824 million in expenses incurred for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia. Who sponsors the national teams? Nine different kit brands sponsor the 32 World Cup teams. Nike supplies the most nations with 13. Followed by Adidas seven nations, who are a FIFA Partner as well. Former German National team Adidas jersey with the 2014 FIFA World Cup Champions batch. Photo by Fachry Zella Devandra on Unsplash Apart from a technical supplier, national federations also partner up with other companies. However, the strict rules from FIFA to protect their brand and income stream make it difficult for these companies to promote their brand around the tournament. FIFA encourages companies and individuals to use generic football or countryrelated images andor terminology that do not incorporate any FIFA Intellectual Property . What is the prize money at the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar? FIFA has set a total prize money purse of 440 million , with the tournament champions receiving 42 million. Prize money 2022 FIFA World Cup Place Prize money Winners 42 million Runnerup 30 million 3rd place 27 million 4th place 25 million 5th 8th place 17 million 9th 16th place 13 million 17th 32nd place 9 million In addition to the 440 million prize money purse, there is 48 million 1.5 million per participating nation in preparation money available. So, each participating country will at least earn 10.5 million. During the 2018 World Cup in Russia the prize money purse was 400 million, with champions France receiving 38 million and runnerup Croatia earning 28 million. The difference with the 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup , which had a total prize money purse of 30 million with the winner receiving 4 million, is substantial. 8 stadiums, including 1 temporary one Eight stadiums across five cities will host 64 matches with the final taking place in Lusail. The Lusail Iconic Stadium has a capacity of 80,000. The Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor has the second highest capacity with 60,000. Doha, Al Rayyan and Al Wakrah each have two stadiums, all with a capacity between 40,000 and 45,000. The stadiums will be reconfigured after the World Cup, with excess seats being donated to other countries or used for the 2030 Asian Games. Stadium 974 will even be completely dismantled after the World Cup, making it the first temporary stadium in World Cup history. The stadium is made of 974 recycled shipping containers 974 is also Qatars international dialing code and the elements will go to lesser developed nations after the event. Photo by Ben Koorengevel on Unsplash All stadiums have cooling systems in place to regulate temperature. Originally this was needed due to the extreme heat in Qatars summers, but in November and December temperatures can be high as well. Attendance figures at the FIFA World Cup So far, the four highest attendance figures at a FIFA World Cup were all during the 1950 tournament in Brazil. With the highest attendance at the Maracan Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, where Uruguay beat Brazil in front of a reported 173,850 people. An earlier match between Brazil and Spain at the same stadium had an attendance figure of 152,772. The fifth and sixth highest attendance figures both 114,600 people were not during the 1950 edition, but during a group match and the final in Mexico City in 1986.

By FAST COMPANY STAFF 5 MINUTE READ With a projected 5 billion people watching this years FIFA World Cup in Qatar, way above half of the worlds population, football offers an opportunity for sponsors wanting to elevate their brands. Companies gear up for the tournament every four years, thinking creatively about marketing campaigns. There are now less than 10 days to the Qatar World Cup 2022, described as a tournament like no other and marketed as an inventive event featuring groundbreaking technologies. Estimates put it at 220 billion, the most expensive World Cup of all time. For the first time, an Arab country is hosting the FIFA World Cup, and Qatar promises fans an unforgettable fourweek 64game soccer tournament that kicks off on November 20. The monthlong football tournament will feature semiautomated offside technology, stadium cooling technology, smart charging stations, and sensory rooms and is backed by brands like Visa, Qatar Airways, Wanda Group, Vivo, Hublot, Adidas, The CocaCola Company, Hyundai, crypto.com and Byjus, among others. As we build up toward the Qatar World Cup 2022, the tournaments sponsors are making the most of the current football fever. VISA For its sponsorship of the beautiful games biggest contest, Visa has created a campaign to unify an audience around the World Cup. The exclusive payment services partner of FIFA unveiled Visa Masters of Movement, a hybrid experience featuring a preevent NFT auction and immersive activation for fans at FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. The auction featured digital art inspired by iconic goals from five legendary footballers minted into unique NFTs, available on Crypto.com. The Visa Masters of Movement experience will come to life on an interactive pitch at the FIFA Fan Festival in Doha and allow fans to create digital art inspired by their signature movements. QATAR AIRWAYS FIFA said organizers have sold more than 2.89 million tickets, nearly the size of the host countrys population. With fans coming in from every corner of the world as 32 nations battle for global supremacy, the stateowned Qatar Airways is ramping up its efforts to accommodate the millions of travelers. Passengers will feel the excitement around the World Cup before stepping foot in Doha thanks to World Cupthemed products and activations, including limitededition amenity kits, souvenir cushions, dining menus, and soccer jerseystyled loungewear. Passengers can also enjoy complimentary live streaming of World Cup matches on flights. HYUNDAI South Korean automotive manufacturer Hyundai started its relationship with FIFA ahead of the 2002 tournament. It has remained a sponsor of the tournament ever since, and in 2010, signed a package deal up until 2022. In April, Hyundai began its Goal of the Century World Cup Campaign to build a sustainable and united world. In July, it launched customer engagement programs like a global test drive centered on ecofriendly vehicles to deliver its message. The test drive was held in 41 countries. Supporting Qatar in hosting the first carbonneutral FIFA World Cup, Hyundai is stepping up to help offset the impact by supplying a fleet of 236 battery electric and hybrid vehicles, like the IONIQ 5, which will debut at the event for the first time at scale. These EVs will transport VIPs, staff members, and for the media. COCACOLA CocaCola is bringing its Believing is Magic campaign to life through several elements, such as digital films, packaging, and fan zone, which bring together football fans worldwide who share the same passion. It started the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour and created a digital hub where fans worldwide can compete, predict winners of FIFA World Cup matches, and connect to social platforms. CocaCola is also working with retail partners to create inperson opportunities for fans to come together, trade stickers, and create digital albums. ADIDAS Since 1970 Adidas has been associated with FIFA as its official partner. The Adidas Al Rihla is the official match ball of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. This will be the 14th consecutive year that the German company will be in charge of manufacturing the tournaments official ball. This year, Adidas has launched an ad film to promote the upcoming football tourney, titled QR to Qatar, highlighting the reward it will offer. The film includes a digital integration of a QR Code that takes the consumer to a live raffle to win various prizes, such as an allexpense paid fourday trip to the FIFA World Cup that covers flight tickets, accommodation, and two match tickets. Adidas is also resurrecting the iconic Predator. Last seen in 2006, when Zinedine Zidane led France out for the World Cup final, the boots combine the gold colorway with some of the Predators signature design touches, including the foldover tongue and curved SL rubber sections. The design is finished with a modern outsole, bringing the Predator Absolute in line with Adidas newest technologies. The shoe goes on sale on November 10 for 350. VIVO Meanwhile, vivo, which signed a sixyear sponsorship agreement with FIFA in 2017, will launch the vivogiveitashot campaign to celebrate the event. Football has the power to bring people together. vivo believes that innovation can help football fans build a community and share exciting World Cup experiences with everyone across the globe, whether they are watching the games at a football stadium or enjoying the experience from afar, said Spark Ni, Senior vice president and chief marketing officer at vivo. Vivo will use the World Cup to promote its new foldable device, the X Fold, the first official foldable smartphone. Smartphones will be supplied to World Cup staff. HISENSE AND MCDONALDS With the football fever heating up, Hisense and McDonalds have teamed up to provide football fans across the region a chance to win TVs, sound bars, and even tickets to the World Cup 2022.

Sponsoring the football World Cup in Qatar comes with reputational risk, but that has not put off Chinese companies. Jon Whiteaker 5 October, 2022 Share Copy Link Share on X Share on Linkedin Share on Facebook Adidas is a longtime sponsor of the World Cup and its official match ball, but who will be joining the German company in sponsoring the tournament in Qatar later in 2022? Photo by Christof StacheAFP via Getty Images Sportwear brand Hummel has every reason to want to promote its relationship with the national football team of Denmark. Hummel first made the Danish football teams kits in 1979 and continued to do so until 2004, during which time the team achieved its greatest triumph being crowned European champions in 1992. Its World Cup team from 1986 is also remembered as one of the most attractive to never win the sports biggest honour. After a 12year break, Hummel became the teams kit sponsor again in 2016 and remains so today. Yet those watching Denmark compete at the FIFA World Cup being held in Qatar from November 2022 will not see the iconic Hummel branding on the teams shirts. In late September 2022, Hummel announced it had toned down its logo and chevrons branding for Denmarks tournament kit in a protest against alleged human rights violations in Qatar.

Find out more We dont wish to be visible during a tournament that has cost thousands of peoples lives, read a brand statement. Qatar has attracted widespread criticism for the reported labour conditions experienced by migrant workers who built from scratch seven of the eight stadia that the tournament will use. Some reports put the death toll in Qatar as high as 6,500 , although this is disputed by the tournaments organising committee. A statement from the Supreme Committee following Hummels announcement said that FIFA had worked with the Qatari government to ensure that the tournament delivers a lasting legacy and that this led to significant reforms to the labour system enacting laws protecting the rights of workers and ensuring improved living conditions for them. Despite this wellrehearsed defence, clearly some corporates think that the risks of being seen to endorse the tournament are too great for a brand to tolerate. The move from Hummel is a small gesture. It will probably raise brand awareness ahead of the tournament, at very little expense to the kit maker, and attract praise from some quarters. The main sponsors of the tournament, in contrast, are under much greater scrutiny. Most have refused to address publicly the controversy surrounding stadium construction in Qatar . If other kit manufacturers or team sponsors make similar gestures, it will increase pressure on them. So who exactly are the brands that have decided to sponsor World Cup 2022? A changing mix of World Cup sponsors Football is big business, and the World Cup, a competition held over four weeks every four years that pits the best national teams from every continent against each other, is the sports biggest international tournament. FIFA claims that 3.75 billion people watched the final game of the 2018 tournament, hosted by Russia, and has predicted as many as five billion could watch the final of Qatar 2022. The World Cup in Russia was the most expensive ever , with a total cost of 14bn. That was a drop in the ocean compared with the 200bn latest cost estimate from the Qatari government for the 2022 event, thanks to the need to build so much new infrastructure. Host countries of major sporting events such as the World Cup hope they will boost inward investment and economic activity, and there are few better platforms for brands to promote themselves globally. FIFA raises billions of dollars through sponsorship deals for each World Cup and its many other international tournaments. Sponsors include some of the biggest brands on Earth. US companies have a long valued the global reach of the FIFA World Cup. CocaCola has been an official sponsor since the 1978 tournament, while McDonald's first became a sponsor in 1994, the only iteration of the tournament to date to be held in the US. Touring the event around the world has seemingly been a good way of picking up sponsors over time. A number of major companies from the host nation will be signed up for each tournament, seeking to be associated with a national success story. The event in 2022 will be no different, with six Qatari companies sponsoring it. Sometimes those sponsors stick. South Korean automotive manufacturer Hyundai started its relationship with FIFA ahead of the 2002 tournament, which was cohosted by Japan and South Korea. It has remained a sponsor of the tournament ever since, and in 2010, signed a package deal up until 2022 that made it a sponsor of a range of male and female football tournaments run by FIFA. The controversial nature of the last two tournaments has seen some longterm sponsors fall away, however. Although they were not as severe as those imposed since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia was already under international sanctions when it hosted the World Cup in 2018 and that seemed to deter some companies. Continental had been a sponsor of the tournament in 2006, 2010 and 2014 but did not extend the relationship further. UK oil company Castrol sponsored two tournaments but didnt return in 2018, and Johnson Johnson of the US was also a main sponsor in 2014 but not 2018. These Western sponsors were replaced in part by local ones, with Russian energy company Gazprom an additional sponsor for 2018. Gazprom had been a keen supporter of football tournaments and teams, having also been a sponsor of the UEFA Champions League, until the war in Ukraine made the company a pariah in the international community. The rise of Chinese sponsorship at the World Cup With Russian money no longer available and some Western sponsors still staying away, the latest World Cup has relied heavily on Chinese sponsorship deals. A year after the 2014 tournament, German sports brand Adidas signed an extension of its rolling sponsorship of the FIFA World Cup, committing itself until 2030 in a deal worth 800m. Adidas has provided the match ball for every World Cup since 1970 and pays a premium to retain its monopoly position ahead of fierce US rival Nike. This deal was surpassed just a year later however by Chinese real estate developer Wanda Group , which signed a 850m deal up until the 2030 tournament. Chinese companies are providing more sponsorship revenue than companies from any other country at the 2022 World Cup 1.4bn from Chinese companies compared with 1.1bn from US companies, according to GlobalData. Even when looking at the annual value of these deals, China is the biggest sponsorship contributor. This is perhaps surprising given that the Chinese team has only qualified once for the World Cup, back in 2002, when the team failed to win a single game. The Chinese companies involved in the World Cup are not exactly household names either, so the global market exposure would seem less valuable to them. Yingli Solar was the first Chinese company to sponsor the World Cup, at the 2010 tournament held in South Africa. It returned in 2014 but ended its relationship with FIFA after that tournament and subsequently fell into financial trouble . It was in 2018, when other companies were turning away from the tournament, that Chinese sponsorship rapidly increased. Tech and entertainment company LUCI, vehicle manufacturer Yadea, China Mengniu Dairy, consumer electronics companies Hinsense and Vivo, and clothing brand Diking all became sponsors that year. Three of those six have returned for the Qatar tournament. With so much sponsorship money coming from local or Chinese companies for the 2022 World Cup, it looks less exposed to public campaigns opposing the tournament. Yet it is likely that as the tournament nears, pressure will be exerted on the Western companies to comment on the human rights charges levelled at the Qatari government. The 2026 World Cup should prove less controversial for FIFA, given that it is being jointly hosted by Canada, the US and Mexico. Whether this results in less reliance on Chinese sponsors remains to be seen. Sign up for our weekly news roundup! Give your business an edge with our leading industry insights.

Despite breaking up the European football season and being clouded by controversy from the getgo, it will likely be a spectacle once again and followed by billions around the world. A look at several business aspects of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, from sponsors to prize money and cost and from attendance figures to stadiums. Who sponsors the FIFA World Cup 2022? FIFA has several sponsorship tiers. There are FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and Regional Sponsors. The governing body is currently implementing a new format with four tiers . By unbundling the womens and esports branch from the mens branch, FIFA hopes to increase overall sponsorship income. German sportswear manufacturer Adidas is a FIFA Partner FIFA Partners Currently there are seven FIFA Partners, who have global rights and can use FIFAs branding during all tournaments and across all branches Adidas sportswear Coca Cola beverage Wanda Group conglomerate HyundaiKia Motors automotive Qatar Airways airline QatarEnergy oil gas Visa financial services FIFA World Cup Sponsors The second tier consist of World Cup Sponsors. These companies have global rights as well but are restricted to the World Cup tournament in the buildup and during. FIFA has seven World Cup Sponsors Budweiser alcoholic beverage and part of AnheuserBusch InBev Byjus educational technology Crypto.com cryptocurrency platform Hisense electronics home appliances McDonalds restaurants real estate Mengniu Dairy dairy products Vivo consumer electronics In the current setup FIFA has six to eight slots for both FIFA Partners and World Cup Sponsors. In the future there is an extra tier between these two that gives rights to all tournaments in a certain branch the mens, womens or esports. Regional Supporters The 2022 FIFA World Cup also has Regional Sponsors. The companies have the same tournament rights but are restricted to one or more of the five regions. FIFA has a maximum of four companies per region.

The total revenue budgeted for 2022 World Cup year is 4,666 million. The amount is made up of five main revenue categories. The sale of television broadcasting rights contributes the most with 56 percent of the total income and amounts to 2,640 million.

Photo by Fachry Zella Devandra on Unsplash Apart from a technical supplier, national federations also partner up with other companies. However, the strict rules from FIFA to protect their brand and income stream make it difficult for these companies to promote their brand around the tournament. FIFA encourages companies and individuals to use generic football or countryrelated images andor terminology that do not incorporate any FIFA Intellectual Property . What is the prize money at the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar? FIFA has set a total prize money purse of 440 million , with the tournament champions receiving 42 million.

So, each participating country will at least earn 10.5 million. During the 2018 World Cup in Russia the prize money purse was 400 million, with champions France receiving 38 million and runnerup Croatia earning 28 million. The difference with the 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup , which had a total prize money purse of 30 million with the winner receiving 4 million, is substantial. 8 stadiums, including 1 temporary one Eight stadiums across five cities will host 64 matches with the final taking place in Lusail. The Lusail Iconic Stadium has a capacity of 80,000. The Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor has the second highest capacity with 60,000. Doha, Al Rayyan and Al Wakrah each have two stadiums, all with a capacity between 40,000 and 45,000. The stadiums will be reconfigured after the World Cup, with excess seats being donated to other countries or used for the 2030 Asian Games. Stadium 974 will even be completely dismantled after the World Cup, making it the first temporary stadium in World Cup history. The stadium is made of 974 recycled shipping containers 974 is also Qatars international dialing code and the elements will go to lesser developed nations after the event. Photo by Ben Koorengevel on Unsplash All stadiums have cooling systems in place to regulate temperature. Originally this was needed due to the extreme heat in Qatars summers, but in November and December temperatures can be high as well.

With the highest attendance at the Maracan Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, where Uruguay beat Brazil in front of a reported 173,850 people.

Sponsoring the football World Cup in Qatar comes with reputational risk, but that has not put off Chinese companies. Jon Whiteaker 5 October, 2022 Share Copy Link Share on X Share on Linkedin Share on Facebook Adidas is a longtime sponsor of the World Cup and its official match ball, but who will be joining the German company in sponsoring the tournament in Qatar later in 2022? Photo by Christof StacheAFP via Getty Images Sportwear brand Hummel has every reason to want to promote its relationship with the national football team of Denmark. Hummel first made the Danish football teams kits in 1979 and continued to do so until 2004, during which time the team achieved its greatest triumph being crowned European champions in 1992. Its World Cup team from 1986 is also remembered as one of the most attractive to never win the sports biggest honour. After a 12year break, Hummel became the teams kit sponsor again in 2016 and remains so today. Yet those watching Denmark compete at the FIFA World Cup being held in Qatar from November 2022 will not see the iconic Hummel branding on the teams shirts. In late September 2022, Hummel announced it had toned down its logo and chevrons branding for Denmarks tournament kit in a protest against alleged human rights violations in Qatar.

Find out more We dont wish to be visible during a tournament that has cost thousands of peoples lives, read a brand statement. Qatar has attracted widespread criticism for the reported labour conditions experienced by migrant workers who built from scratch seven of the eight stadia that the tournament will use. Some reports put the death toll in Qatar as high as 6,500 , although this is disputed by the tournaments organising committee. A statement from the Supreme Committee following Hummels announcement said that FIFA had worked with the Qatari government to ensure that the tournament delivers a lasting legacy and that this led to significant reforms to the labour system enacting laws protecting the rights of workers and ensuring improved living conditions for them. Despite this wellrehearsed defence, clearly some corporates think that the risks of being seen to endorse the tournament are too great for a brand to tolerate. The move from Hummel is a small gesture. It will probably raise brand awareness ahead of the tournament, at very little expense to the kit maker, and attract praise from some quarters. The main sponsors of the tournament, in contrast, are under much greater scrutiny. Most have refused to address publicly the controversy surrounding stadium construction in Qatar . If other kit manufacturers or team sponsors make similar gestures, it will increase pressure on them. So who exactly are the brands that have decided to sponsor World Cup 2022? A changing mix of World Cup sponsors Football is big business, and the World Cup, a competition held over four weeks every four years that pits the best national teams from every continent against each other, is the sports biggest international tournament. FIFA claims that 3.75 billion people watched the final game of the 2018 tournament, hosted by Russia, and has predicted as many as five billion could watch the final of Qatar 2022. The World Cup in Russia was the most expensive ever , with a total cost of 14bn. That was a drop in the ocean compared with the 200bn latest cost estimate from the Qatari government for the 2022 event, thanks to the need to build so much new infrastructure. Host countries of major sporting events such as the World Cup hope they will boost inward investment and economic activity, and there are few better platforms for brands to promote themselves globally. FIFA raises billions of dollars through sponsorship deals for each World Cup and its many other international tournaments. Sponsors include some of the biggest brands on Earth. US companies have a long valued the global reach of the FIFA World Cup. CocaCola has been an official sponsor since the 1978 tournament, while McDonald's first became a sponsor in 1994, the only iteration of the tournament to date to be held in the US. Touring the event around the world has seemingly been a good way of picking up sponsors over time. A number of major companies from the host nation will be signed up for each tournament, seeking to be associated with a national success story. The event in 2022 will be no different, with six Qatari companies sponsoring it. Sometimes those sponsors stick. South Korean automotive manufacturer Hyundai started its relationship with FIFA ahead of the 2002 tournament, which was cohosted by Japan and South Korea. It has remained a sponsor of the tournament ever since, and in 2010, signed a package deal up until 2022 that made it a sponsor of a range of male and female football tournaments run by FIFA. The controversial nature of the last two tournaments has seen some longterm sponsors fall away, however. Although they were not as severe as those imposed since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia was already under international sanctions when it hosted the World Cup in 2018 and that seemed to deter some companies. Continental had been a sponsor of the tournament in 2006, 2010 and 2014 but did not extend the relationship further. UK oil company Castrol sponsored two tournaments but didnt return in 2018, and Johnson Johnson of the US was also a main sponsor in 2014 but not 2018. These Western sponsors were replaced in part by local ones, with Russian energy company Gazprom an additional sponsor for 2018. Gazprom had been a keen supporter of football tournaments and teams, having also been a sponsor of the UEFA Champions League, until the war in Ukraine made the company a pariah in the international community. The rise of Chinese sponsorship at the World Cup With Russian money no longer available and some Western sponsors still staying away, the latest World Cup has relied heavily on Chinese sponsorship deals. A year after the 2014 tournament, German sports brand Adidas signed an extension of its rolling sponsorship of the FIFA World Cup, committing itself until 2030 in a deal worth 800m. Adidas has provided the match ball for every World Cup since 1970 and pays a premium to retain its monopoly position ahead of fierce US rival Nike. This deal was surpassed just a year later however by Chinese real estate developer Wanda Group , which signed a 850m deal up until the 2030 tournament. Chinese companies are providing more sponsorship revenue than companies from any other country at the 2022 World Cup 1.4bn from Chinese companies compared with 1.1bn from US companies, according to GlobalData. Even when looking at the annual value of these deals, China is the biggest sponsorship contributor. This is perhaps surprising given that the Chinese team has only qualified once for the World Cup, back in 2002, when the team failed to win a single game. The Chinese companies involved in the World Cup are not exactly household names either, so the global market exposure would seem less valuable to them. Yingli Solar was the first Chinese company to sponsor the World Cup, at the 2010 tournament held in South Africa. It returned in 2014 but ended its relationship with FIFA after that tournament and subsequently fell into financial trouble . It was in 2018, when other companies were turning away from the tournament, that Chinese sponsorship rapidly increased. Tech and entertainment company LUCI, vehicle manufacturer Yadea, China Mengniu Dairy, consumer electronics companies Hinsense and Vivo, and clothing brand Diking all became sponsors that year. Three of those six have returned for the Qatar tournament. With so much sponsorship money coming from local or Chinese companies for the 2022 World Cup, it looks less exposed to public campaigns opposing the tournament. Yet it is likely that as the tournament nears, pressure will be exerted on the Western companies to comment on the human rights charges levelled at the Qatari government. The 2026 World Cup should prove less controversial for FIFA, given that it is being jointly hosted by Canada, the US and Mexico. Whether this results in less reliance on Chinese sponsors remains to be seen. Sign up for our weekly news roundup! Give your business an edge with our leading industry insights.

Similar to previous seasons we analyse the kit and shirt sponsors of the 32 teams participating in the 20232024 UEFA Champions League UCL. We also take a look at UEFAs Champions League sponsors and partners. Kit sponsors 32 teams, nine brands Nine different clothing brands sponsor the 32 Champions League teams this season. Two more than during each of the last three seasons. Adidas, Castore, EA7, Jako, Macron, Mizuno, New Balance, Nike including Nike Jordan and Puma are all represented. Adidas and Nike are the main kit suppliers with each eight teams. For Adidas that is the same number of teams as last season. While Nike supplied 12 Champions League teams last year. Nike sponsors five league champions, including Ligue 1 champions PSG, who alternates between a Nike and Nike Jordan kit. Adidas sponsors UCL giants Real Madrid and Bayern Mnchen. They also supply Manchester United, Arsenal, Celtic, Benfica, Copenhagen and debutant Union Berlin. Together Nike and Adidas partner with 50 percent of the 20232024 Champions League teams. Puma sponsors seven teams German brand Puma sponsors seven teams, including Premier League champions Manchester City. Puma signed a tenyear partnership worth a reported 650 million with the City Football Group Manchester Citys parent company before the 20192020 season. British brand Castore fourth biggest supplier with three teams Castore is rapidly gaining ground across sports and in football. The British brand first gained prominence by partnering with tennis player Andy Murray back in 2019. This season, the brand sponsors three Champions League teams Sevilla, Newcastle United and Eredivisie champions Feyenoord. Macron sponsors Real Sociedad and Crevena zvezda. While Jako Antwerp, Mizuno Lazio, New Balance Porto, and EA7 Napoli each sponsor one team. 20232024 Champions League Kit Sponsors Team country Kit Sponsor Check on Amazon Affiliate link RB Salzburg AUT Nike Antwerp BEL Jako Copenhagen DEN Adidas Arsenal ENG Adidas Home Away Third Newcastle United ENG Castore Manchester City ENG Puma Home Away Third Manchester United ENG Adidas Home Away Third Atltico Madrid ESP Nike Home Away Third FC Barcelona ESP Nike Home Away Third Real Madrid ESP Adidas Home Away Third Real Sociedad ESP Macron Home Sevilla FC ESP Castore Third Lens FRA Puma Home Third Paris SaintGermain FRA NikeJordan Home Away Third Bayern Mnchen GER Adidas Home Away Third Borussia Dortmund GER Puma Home Away RB Leipzig GER Nike Home Union Berlin GER Adidas Inter ITA Nike Third Lazio ITA Mizuno AC Milan ITA Puma Home Away Third Napoli ITA EA7 Feyenoord NED Castore PSV NED Puma Home Away Third Benfica POR Adidas Home Braga POR Puma Porto POR New Balance Celtic SCO Adidas Third Crevena zvezda SRB Macron Young Boys SUI Nike Galatasaray TUR Nike Shakhtar Donetsk UKR Puma Shirt sponsors 14 industries, seven airline companies 23 different companies sponsor the 20232024 Champions League teams. Three less than last year. We can roughly categorise the companies into 14 different industries. The airline industry sponsors the most teams with seven, which comes down to 22 percent of the teams. Last season, the gambling industry had the most seven shirt sponsorships in the Champions League. This year, the industry sponsor four teams. As many sides as companies from the entertainment industry sponsor. There are also two conglomerate Red Bull and oil and gas Gazprom and Socar sponsors. The financial services industry is normally a frequent partner four teams last season. This season there is just one such sponsor. Alternative for gambling sponsorship As gambling advertising is prohibited in some countries, several clubs could have no or a different logo on their kits in certain matches. Antwerp, for example, played with nonprofit initiative Antwerp First on their shirts during their away tie with Barcelona. As gambling sponsorship is prohibited in Spain. In the league, the Belgian champions normally play with gambling logo betFIRST on their fronts. Scottish champions Celtic normally plays with gambling logo Dafabet on their shirts. However, the company has donated their spot to the Celtic FC Foundation during UCL away ties. Galatasaray and Dortmund do not have a gambling shirt sponsor, but both teams feature a different sponsor during their Champions League or Cup matches than during their league encounters. This could be due to for example financial reasons or sponsors desired target group national vs. international. Shirt sponsor of multiple teams Three companies sponsor multiple teams. Airline Emirates sponsors four teams Real Madrid, AC Milan, Benfica, and Arsenal. While Paramount Inter and Union Berlin and Red Bull Salzburg and Leipzig both sponsor two Champions League sides. Shirt sponsors of multiple UCL teams Company Number of clubs Clubs Emirates 4 Real Madrid, AC Milan, Benfica, and Arsenal Paramount 2 Inter and Union Berlin Red Bull 2 Salzburg and Leipzig The sponsorship of Red Bull is of course a unique case. Red Bull, a conglomerate that started out as a beverage manufacturer, acts as shirt sponsor for both Leipzig and Salzburg. At the same time, the Austrian brand is owner of both clubs and although the clubs are known as Red Bull Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg, UEFA does not allow the use of Red Bull curing UCL ties. Where do the shirt sponsors come from? The shirt sponsors have their headquarters on three different continents. Most come from Europe 16, followed by Asian countries 10. This includes eight Middle Eastern sponsors. Furthermore, there are two North American sponsors. As country, the UAE five and Germany three have the most shirt sponsorship deals. For Germany these are three different companies, while that is two for the UAE . Only nine teams have a shirt sponsor from their home nation, including two out of the four German teams. 20232024 Champions League Shirt Sponsors Team country Shirt Sponsor Industry HQ RB Salzburg AUT Red Bull Conglomerate beverage media Austria Antwerp BEL betFIRST Antwerp First Gambling Copenhagen DEN Arsenal ENG Emirates Airline Dubai, UAE Newcastle United ENG Sela Entertainment hospitality Saudi Arabia Manchester City ENG Etihad Airways Airline Abu Dhabi, UAE Manchester United ENG Team Viewer Software Germany Atltico Madrid ESP Riyahd Air Airline Saudi Arabia FC Barcelona ESP Spotify Entertainment audio streaming Sweden Real Madrid ESP Emirates Airline Dubai, UAE Real Sociedad ESP Sevilla FC ESP Lens FRA Auchan Retail France Paris SaintGermain FRA Qatar Airways Airline Qatar Bayern Mnchen GER Deutsche Telekom Telecommunications Germany Borussia Dortmund GER Evonik Specialty chemicals Germany RB Leipzig GER Red Bull Conglomerate beverage media Austria Union Berlin GER Paramount Entertainment OTT streaming USA Inter ITA Paramount Entertainment OTT streaming USA Lazio ITA AC Milan ITA Emirates Airline Dubai, UAE Napoli ITA MSC Tourism transportation Switzerland Feyenoord NED EuroParcs Tourism holiday parks Netherlands PSV NED Brainport Eindhoven Technology ecosystem Netherlands Benfica POR Emirates Airline Dubai, UAE Braga POR Moosh.pt Gambling Portugal Porto POR Betano Gambling Greece Celtic SCO Dafabet Celtic FC Foundation Gambling Philippines Crevena zvezda SRB Gazprom Oil and gas Russia Young Boys SUI Plus500 Financial services UK Galatasaray TUR Socar Oil and gas Azerbaijan Shakhtar Donetsk UKR SCM CKM Holding Ukraine Sleeve sponsorships From the 20212022 season onwards, Champions League teams are allowed to have a sleeve sponsor. Clubs have to adhere to strict regulation, but UEFA introduced it in a bid to make up for lost revenue during the COVID19 pandemic. So far, 27 out of 32 teams play with a sleeve sponsorship patch during their matches. Four partners are active in the gambling industry. While there are three sleeve sponsors from both the ecommerce and tourism industries. There are also two automotive, airline, beverage and sports retail sleeve sponsors.

In 2021, FedEx and Just Eat Takeaway.com joined UEFAs Champions League roster, with the latter also sponsoring the UEFA Europa League and womens football. Heineken also sponsors multiple UEFA competitions and tournaments, including the Champions League and Europa League. However, where the Dutch manufacturer promotes their alcoholic brand in the UCL, they promote their 0,0 beer in the Europa League. Each brand has their own activation opportunities in addition to visibility in and around the stadium. For example Playstation PS5 awards the Player of the Match and is associated with the UEFA Gaming Hub UCL Fantasy and Predictor games. While Mastercard has been associated with the Player Mascots Programme for years. Oppo instead of Gazprom In February 2022, UEFA terminated their deal with Russian oil and gas company Gazprom across all competitions as a response to the RussianUkrainian war. A loss of revenue for the governing body, which was compensated by adding Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer Oppo to their partners in July of that year. The Champions Leagues global appeal is noticeable, with all partners being major international brands. Six out of nine sponsors have their headquarters outside Europe, with four in the USA and one in both Japan and China.

More teams 36, more matches 189 and more ties between top teams early on, have to make Europes biggest club competition even more appealing. Similar to previous seasons we analyse the kit and shirt sponsors of the 36 teams participating in the 20242025 UEFA Champions League UCL. Kit sponsors 36 teams, nine brands Nine different clothing brands sponsor the 36 Champions League teams this season. The same amount as last season , despite the competition expanding by four teams. Adidas, Castore, Jako, Joma, Kappa, Macron, New Balance, Nike and Puma are all represented. Compared to last season, EA7 and Mizuno do not sponsor a Champions League side this campaign. While Joma and Kappa do. Adidas, Nike, and Puma sponsor 72 percent of the 202425 Champions League teams Adidas is the main kit supplier with 10 teams 28 percent. During eight out of 10 seasons since 201516, Adidas has sponsored the most Champions League teams. During the 202324 season , the German brand supplied a quarter of the teams eight. Which was the tiedmost with Nike. The swoosh brand once again partners eight teams. Just as Puma, who had seven teams last season. Together these three major sports brands sponsor 72 percent of the teams during the 202425 season. Which is equal to last season. British brand Castore fourth biggest supplier with four teams Castore is rapidly gaining ground across sports and in football. The British brand first gained prominence by partnering with tennis player Andy Murray back in 2019. This season, the brand sponsors four Champions League teams Club Brugge, Dinamo Zagreb, Bayer Leverkusen, and Feyenoord. With the Dutch club one of the three clubs Castore also sponsored last campaign. Macron sponsors Bologna and Red Star Belgrade. While Jako Stuttgart, Joma Atalanta, Kappa Monaco, and New Balance Lille each sponsor one team. Highest value kit sponsorships per year With the value of kit sponsorship deals rarely made public, it is hard to determine the exact amounts clubs earn from these sponsorships. However, reported values give a general idea of which 202425 Champions League teams earn the most annually. Real Madrid and Adidas between 110 and 150 million per year Adidas has been the kit supplier of the defending champions since 1998. Currently running until 2028, the deal is reportedly worth between 110 and 150 million per year. Barcelona and Nike between 105 and 127 million per year Renewed in 2024 until 2038, the deal is said to worth around 105 and 127 million per year. There were rumours about Puma taking over, but eventually the club continued the partnership with Nike that started in 1998. Arsenal and Adidas 89 million per year Arsenal and Adidas partnered up in 2019 and have since extended their deal. Currently, the deal is reportedly worth 75 million 89 million per year. Manchester City and Puma 77 million per year Puma signed a tenyear partnership worth a reported 650 million with the City Football Group Manchester Citys parent company before the 20192020 season. PSG and Nike between 55 between 75 million per year PSG and Nike extended their partnership until 2032 in 2019. The deal is reportedly worth between 55 and 75 million. The partnership also includes the Parisian club wearing and promoting Nikes Jordan brand. Chelsea and Nike 71 million per year Chelsea reportedly earns 60 million 71 million from their 15year contract with Nike which runs until 2032. Liverpool and Nike 35 million per year 20 percent royalty on net shirt sales The Reds have worn Nike kits since 2020. Reportedly earning between 30 and 60 million 35 and 71 million from the deal. As they receive a 20 percent royalty from shirt sales, it is difficult to pinpoint their revenue or compare it with others. In 2025, they will switch to Adidas in a deal said to be worth over 60 million 71 million per year. 20242025 Champions League kit sponsors Team country Kit Sponsor Check on Amazon Affiliate link RB Salzburg AUT Puma Club Brugge BEL Castore Dinamo Zagreb CRO Castore Sparta Prague CZE Adidas Arsenal ENG Adidas Home Away Aston Villa ENG Adidas Liverpool ENG Nike Manchester City ENG Puma Home Away Third Fourth Europe Atltico Madrid ESP Nike FC Barcelona ESP Nike Girona ESP Puma Real Madrid ESP Adidas Home Away Third Brest FRA Adidas Lille FRA New Balance Monaco FRA Kappa Paris SaintGermain FRA Nike Bayer Leverkusen GER Castore Bayern Mnchen GER Adidas Home Away Borussia Dortmund GER Puma Home Away RB Leipzig GER Puma VfB Stuttgart GER Jako Atalanta ITA Joma Bologna ITA Macron Inter ITA Nike Juventus ITA Adidas Home AC Milan ITA Puma Home Third Feyenoord NED Castore PSV NED Puma Benfica POR Adidas Sporting POR Nike Celtic SCO Adidas Crevena zvezda SRB Macron Slovan Bratislava SVK Adidas Sturm Graz SUI Nike Young Boys SUI Nike Shakhtar Donetsk UKR Puma Shirt sponsors 15 industries, nine deals with gambling firms 30 different companies sponsor the 202425 Champions League teams. Which is seven more than last season. We can categorise the companies into 15 different industries. Nine clubs have a partnership with a gambling company. While eight teams feature an airline on their fronts. Four shirt sponsors are active in the food and beverage industry, including two different dairy companies. Across leagues, clubs also often partner with companies from the financial services industry. In the Champions League only two clubs Liverpool and Young Boys have such a partner. Alternative shirt sponsors due to legislation or donation There are clubs who have a different or no logo on their shirts during specific matches. This could be because they are playing in a country where gambling or alcohol advertising is partly prohibited. Such as in Spain and France. There are also companies who donate their space to a nonprofit organisation. Celtic, for example, plays with gambling logo Dafabet on their shirts during Champions League home games. During away ties, the space is reserved for the Celtic FC Foundation. While Sportings main sponsor logo Betano is replaced by the gambling companys social initiative Heros during selected matches. Shirt sponsor of multiple teams Four companies sponsor multiple teams. Airline Emirates sponsors four teams defending champion Real Madrid, AC Milan, Benfica, and Arsenal. Betano sponsors three teams. While Etihad Airways, and Red Bull each sponsor two Champions League sides. Shirt sponsors of multiple Champions League teams Company Number of clubs Clubs Emirates 4 Arsenal, Benfica, Milan, and Real Madrid Betano 3 Aston Villa, Sparta Prague, and Sporting Etihad Airways 2 Girona and Manchester City Red Bull 2 Leipzig and Salzburg The sponsorship of Etihad Airways and Red Bull are unique cases. They both sponsor two Champions League clubs who are part of the same group or ownership. Girona, part of the City Football Group like Manchester City, agreed a deal with Etihad Airway in 2024. The deal is reportedly worth 2 million per year. Far less than Citys reported 65 million per year deal. Red Bull, a conglomerate that started out as a beverage manufacturer, acts as shirt sponsor for both Leipzig and Salzburg. At the same time, the Austrian brand is owner of both clubs and although the clubs are known as Red Bull Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg, UEFA does not allow the use of Red Bull curing UCL ties. Top five shirt sponsorships with the highest value Like kit sponsorship deals, shirt sponsorships can generate quite the revenue for clubs. Especially for Europes biggest clubs who have a tendency to go far in the Champions League and other competitions.

First introduced by UEFA in a bid to make up for lost revenue during the COVID19 pandemic, the rule has not been reversed. Offering an extra revenue option for clubs. This season, 33 out of 36 teams have featured a sponsor on their sleeves. With 92 percent of the teams this is eight percent points more than last season 27 out of 32. The companies can be categorised into 17 different industries. The financial services industry has the most partnerships six. In particular, online trading and cryptocurrency companies. The tourism sector has four partnerships, amongst others with Premier League clubs Arsenal Visit Rwanda and Liverpool Expedia. There are just three gambling sleeve sponsorships. While that is the industry with the most frontofshirt sponsors amongst this seasons teams. The airline industry, the sector with the second most shirt sponsorships, has no sleeve deals. A further six industries consumer electronics, construction, entertainment, insurance, food and beverage, and nonprofit have at least two deals in place. Multiple partnerships No sleeve sponsor partners with multiple Champions League teams. While there were three such companies last campaign. Including Toto, who sponsored both Eredivisie teams Feyenoord and PSV. The firm still does in the league. However, PSVs spot is donated to the clubs foundation during the majority of the European ties.

Similar to previous seasons we analyse the kit and shirt sponsors of the 32 teams participating in the 20222023 UEFA Champions League UCL. We also take a look at UEFAs Champions League sponsors and partners. NOTE This article is subject to change when new deals are announced. Kit sponsors 32 teams, seven brands Seven different clothing brands sponsor the 32 Champions League teams this season. The same amount as during the 20212022 and 20202021 campaigns. Adidas, Castore, EA7, Macron, New Balance, Nike and Puma are all represented. Nike is the main kit supplier with 12 teams, including PSG who alternates between a Nike and a Nike Jordan kit. The American brand sponsors at least one Champions League participant of each of the Big Five leagues. Moreover, they also sponsor both Red Bull Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg. Adidas follows Nike by sponsoring eight teams, including defending champion Real Madrid and Ajax. The Amsterdam club released their European jersey made in partnership with Amsterdam fashion brand Daily Paper. Like last seasons Bob Marleyinspired jersey, UEFA does not allow for all details to be used during matches. So the official match jerseys are slightly different. Together Nike and Adidas partner with 63 percent of the 20222023 Champions League teams. German brand Puma sponsors five teams, including Premier League champions Manchester City. Puma signed a tenyear partnership worth a reported 650 million with the City Football Group Manchester Citys parent company before the 20192020 season. British brand Castore sponsors three teams Castore is rapidly gaining ground across sports and in football. The British brand first gained prominence by partnering with tennis player Andy Murray back in 2019. This season the brand sponsors three Champions League teams. They sponsor Rangers since 2020 and have added Sevilla and Bayer Leverkusen before the 20222023 campaign. Sevilla and Bayer Leverkusen are also the only two clubs to have switched to a new kit supplier this season. Previously, they wore Nike and Jako respectively. Macron sponsors Club Brugge and Viktoria Plzen, while New Balance Porto and EA7 Napoli both only sponsor one team. However, the Italian brand and the Serie A club released 13 different kits last season, including a Halloween edition. Napolis president Aurelio De Laurentiis admitted that a similar amount of kits could be released this season. 20222023 Champions League Kit Sponsors Team country Kit Sponsor Buy from Amazon Paid Link RB Salzburg AUT Nike Club Brugge BEL Macron Dinamo Zagreb CRO Adidas Viktoria Plzen CZE Macron Copenhagen DEN Adidas Chelsea FC ENG Nike Liverpool FC ENG Nike Manchester City ENG Puma Home Away Third Tottenham Hotspur ENG Nike Atltico Madrid ESP Nike FC Barcelona ESP Nike Real Madrid ESP Adidas Home Away Sevilla FC ESP Castore Olympique de Marseille FRA Puma Paris SaintGermain FRA Nike Jordan Home Bayer 04 Leverkusen GER Castore Bayern Mnchen GER Adidas Home Borussia Dortmund GER Puma Home Away Eintracht Frankfurt GER Nike RB Leipzig GER Nike Maccabi Haifa ISR Nike Inter ITA Nike Juventus ITA Adidas Home Away AC Milan ITA Puma Home Away Napoli ITA EA7 AFC Ajax NED Adidas Home Third Benfica POR Adidas Porto POR New Balance Home Away Third Sporting CP POR Nike Celtic SCO Adidas Home Away Rangers SCO Castore Shakhtar Donetsk UKR Puma Shirt sponsors 14 industries, seven gambling 26 different companies sponsor the 20222023 Champions League teams. Unibet Club Brugge, Copenhagen and Rangers and airline Emirates Real Madrid, AC Milan and Benfica sponsor three teams each. While gambling firm Betano Porto and Sporting and Red Bull Salzburg and Leipzig both partner with two Champions League teams. We can roughly categorise the companies into 14 different industries. The gambling industry sponsors the most teams with seven teams, which is 22 percent of the teams. In the 20222023 Premier League it is 40 percent eight teams. However, none of the Premier League sides that qualified for the Champions Leagues have a gambling shirt sponsor. As gambling advertising is prohibited in some countries, several clubs could have no or a different logo on their kits in certain matches. For example, Porto played with Heris.pt on their shirt during their away match at Atltico Madrid, instead of Betano. Since 2021, Spain prohibits gambling advertising and so Portos shirt sponsor was changed to Betanos social responsibility program in Portugal. Airline and financial services firms popular The airline industry follows by sponsoring five clubs, while the financial services sector sponsors four teams. The main industries are comparable to previous seasons. Although the airline sector has made a resurgence after only sponsoring two teams in 20202021. Choosing between shirt sponsors In the Serie A, Napoli has two shirt sponsors water brand Lete and transportation company MSC . However, UEFA only allows for one shirt sponsor in European competitions and Napoli has chosen Lete. This is one of three beverage related sponsorships. The other two are between Red Bull, a conglomerate that started out as a beverage manufacturer, and Leipzig and Salzburg. The Austrian brand is owner of both clubs and although the clubs are known as Red Bull Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg, UEFA does not allow the use of Red Bull in their official name. Where do the shirt sponsors come from? The shirt sponsors have their headquarters on three different continents. Most come from Europe 20, followed by Asian countries 9. This includes five Middle Eastern countries. Furthermore, there are two North American sponsors. As country, the UAE four, Germany and Malta both three have the most shirt sponsorship deals. For Germany these are three different companies, while that is two and one for the UAE and Malta respectively. Only 10 teams have a shirt sponsor from their home nation, including three out of the five German teams. 20222023 Champions League Shirt Sponsors Team country Shirt Sponsor Industry HQ RB Salzburg AUT Red Bull Conglomerate beverage media Austria Club Brugge BEL Unibet Gambling Malta Dinamo Zagreb CRO PSK Gambling Croatia Viktoria Plzen CZE Doosan koda Power Energy Czech Republic Copenhagen DEN Unibet Gambling Maalt Chelsea FC ENG Three Telecommunications Hong Kong Liverpool FC ENG Standard Chartered Financial services banking UK Manchester City ENG Etihad Airways Airline UAE Tottenham Hotspur ENG AIA Life insurance financial services Hong Kong Atltico Madrid ESP WhaleFin.com Financial services Singapore FC Barcelona ESP Spotify Entertainment audio streaming Sweden Real Madrid ESP Emirates Airline UAE Sevilla FC ESP DEGIRO Financial services online broker Netherlands Olympique de Marseille FRA Cazoo Ecommerce car retailer UK Paris SaintGermain FRA Qatar Airways Airline Qatar Bayer 04 Leverkusen GER Barmenia Insurance Germany Bayern Mnchen GER Deutsche Telekom Telecommunications Germany Borussia Dortmund GER Evonik Specialty chemicals Germany Eintracht Frankfurt GER Indeed Online job search engine USA RB Leipzig GER Red Bull Conglomerate beverage media Austria Maccabi Haifa ISR Volvo Automotive Sweden Inter ITA Digitalbits Financial services blockchain North America Juventus ITA Jeep Automotive USA AC Milan ITA Emirates Airline UAE Napoli ITA Lete Beverage water Italy AFC Ajax NED Ziggo Telecommunications Netherlands Benfica POR Emirates Airline UAE Porto POR Betano Gambling Greece Sporting CP POR Betano Gambling Greece Celtic SCO Dafabet Gambling Philippines Rangers SCO Unibet Gambling Malta Shakhtar Donetsk UKR SCM CKM Holding Ukraine Sleeve sponsorships From the 20212022 season onwards, Champions League teams are allowed to have a sleeve sponsor.

Four partners are active in both the financial services and beverage sectors. This includes two cryptocurrency platforms and three alcoholic beverages twice Superbock. There are also three ecommerce related firms and three automotive companies acting as sleeve sponsor.

Currently, all deals run until the end of the 20232024 season. In 2021, FedEx and Just Eat Takeaway.com joined UEFAs Champions League roster, with the latter also sponsoring the UEFA Europa League and womens football. Heineken also sponsors multiple UEFA competitions and tournaments, including the Champions League and Europa League. However, where the Dutch manufacturer promotes their alcoholic brand in the UCL, they promote their 0,0 beer in the Europa League. Each brand has their own activation opportunities in addition to visibility in and around the stadium. For example Playstation PS5 awards the Player of the Match and is associated with the UEFA Gaming Hub UCL Fantasy and Predictor games. While Mastercard has been associated with the Player Mascots Programme for years. Oppo instead of Gazprom In February 2022, UEFA terminated their deal with Russian oil and gas company Gazprom across all competitions as a response to the RussianUkrainian war. A loss of revenue for the governing body, but they were able to compensate it by adding Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer Oppo in July. The Champions Leagues global appeal is noticeable, with all partners being major international brands. Five out of seven sponsors have their headquarters outside Europe with three in the USA and one in both Japan and China. The two European sponsors both have their headquarters in the Netherlands. 20222023 UEFA Champions League Sponsors Partner Industry Headquarters Heineken Beverages alcohol Netherlands Playstation PS5 Video gaming Japan PepsiCo incl.

It took place between 7 June and 7 July 2019, with 52 matches staged in nine cities in France , 1 which was awarded the right to host the event in March 2015, the first time the country hosted the tournament. The tournament was the first Women's World Cup to use the video assistant referee VAR system. This was the second and last edition with 24 teams before expanding to 32 teams for the 2023 tournament in Australia and New Zealand . The United States entered the competition as defending champions after winning the 2015 edition in Canada and successfully defended their title with a 20 victory over the Netherlands in the final . In doing so, they secured their record fourth title and became the second nation, after Germany , to have successfully retained the title. Unlike Germany, however, this victory held a distinction as the United States won both 2015 and 2019 tournaments under one manager, Jill Ellis . It was the first time in 81 years since Vittorio Pozzo did so for the Italian men's team at the 1934 and 1938 FIFA World Cups . The matches were broadcast globally and attracted a combined audience of 1.12 billion people.

With 24 teams, four debutants, nine host cities, 52 matches and only one winner, SportsPro presents its comprehensive guide to all you need to know before France play Korea on 7th June in Paris. 6 June 2019 Joe Levy Analysis SHARE THIS ARTICLE The Fifa Womens World Cup France 2019 is going to be the biggest womens sporting event of the year, says Sarai Bareman, Fifas chief womens soccer officer. Given the momentum, clamour and excitement for the eighth edition of Womens World Cup, that is hardly a bold statement. From fans to broadcasters, sponsors to players France 2019 looks set to be a significant moment in womens sport. A pinnacle in itself, but also a springboard to elevate the womens game beyond what has come before. More than 940,000 tickets have been sold so far across the nine host cities in France, with the opening fixture, semifinals and final all selling out within 48 hours of release. Visa has launched its biggest ever sponsorship activation for a womens soccer event across 33 individual markets. Teams have seen a wave of sponsors chomping at the bit to ride the seemingly everincreasing wave of womens soccers popularity. England have secured deals with Boots, Budweiser and Lucozade ahead of the tournament. Whilst it is cynical to be sceptical of the sudden appearances of major brands ahead of a global tournament, its shows that the reach of the Womens World Cup is expanding at a rate of knots. Broadcasters are producing slick, original and engaging content ahead of the tournament too. For the first time the BBC, the UKs public broadcaster, is giving the womens tournament the same editorial backing it gives the men. Fifa itself recently embarked on the rollout of its Womens Soccer Strategy, which aims to have 60 million women playing soccer by 2026. Whilst perhaps these are all endeavours that recognise that in the past too little has been done for womens soccer far too late, a focus on showcasing the womens game and developing commercial opportunities, alongside the grassroots and skills development, could well go some way to ensuring such mistakes are avoided in the future. However, all is not entirely rosy in the garden. Equal pay, treatment and recognition are still some way short of where they should be. The US team is in dispute with its national association the world's best player is absent, citing inequality as a main factor, and several sides still lack the support given to their male counterparts. Here, on the eve of the tournament, SportsPro presents its definitive Fifa Womens World Cup commercial preview.

But the upper salary limit for women players in the WK League, the womens equivalent, was just three per cent of that, at KRW50 million US42,000. In 2015, the Korea Football Association KFA faced public criticism for providing members of the mens national team with businessclass air tickets, while women players got economy. The KFA reportedly said that male players bring much more money.

Hegerberg explained I've always respected men's footballers for what they earn. The gap is enormous, but at the same time you need to give young women and girls the same opportunity as the men. That's where we need to do the change. There are federations, there are clubs, there are men in high positions who have that responsibility to put the women in the right place and that's where I think, I feel, and I know, we have a long way to go.

Photo by Dorian Hurst on Unsplash Womens football has arrived and some more. This summer the FIFA Womens World Cup, the quadrennial international football competition for womens national teams, takes place. Hopefully the event will accelerate the sports worldwide growth even more. Below we take a look at a few of the business aspects of the 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup, from location to prize money and from attendance figures to sponsors. France hosts the 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup The 8th edition of the FIFA Womens World Cup takes place in France from June 7th to July 7th. Nine cities will host 24 teams across 52 matches with the final taking place in Lyon. France is not new to hosting FIFA tournaments, as the country already organised the 1938 and 1998 mens World Cup editions. cookie height100 width100 httpsx.comFIFAWWCstatus1110889475004121089 cookie Prize money at the 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup The prize money for the 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup has doubled compared to the 2015 edition. FIFA has set a total prize money purse of 30 million, with the tournament champions receiving 4 million. A figure that is also double the amount the 2015 champions USA received. Prize money 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup Place Prize money Winners 4 million Runnersup 2.6 million 3rd 2 million 4th 1.6 million 5th 8th 1.45 million 9th 16th 1 million 17th 24th 750,000 In addition to the 30 million prize money purse, FIFA will distribute 20 million for tournament preparations and the Club Benefits Program. Yet while there is an increase in price money, there is also an increase in the gap between prize money for men and women. During the 2018 World Cup in Russia the men teams were awarded a total of 400 million, with champions France receiving 38 million. This is a huge difference in any case and definitely for those advocating equal prize money. Several sponsors, spearheaded by Adidas, try to address this gap. The German clothing and sporting goods manufacturer announced that sponsored players on the winning 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup team will receive the same performance bonus as their male counterparts. Attendance figures of the FIFA Womens World Cup With womens football growing rapidly and attracting more and more attention, the gap between men and womens football will likely shrink in the future. Recently various matches across Europe had recordbreaking attendance figures. It is therefore expected that attendance figures will be quite high at the 2019 tournament. Especially since FIFA has announced that ticket sales for the competition are smashing records, with over 720,000 sold so far. So far the highest attendance figure at a FIFA Womens World Cup was during the 1999 final in the USA. At the Rose Bowl Stadium in Los Angeles the USA beat China in front of 90,185 people. The opening match of the same edition had an attendance figure nearing 80,000. The second highest final attendance was set in China in 1991. In the Guangzhou Tianhe Stadium 63,000 people saw the USA beat Norway. The 2015 final between the USA and Japan took place in front of 53,341 people in Vancouver, Canada. Attendance FIFA Womens World Cup finals Year Country Attendance 1991 China 63,000 1995 Sweden 17,158 1999 USA 90,185 2003 USA 26,137 2007 China 31,000 2011 Germany 48,817 2015 Canada 53,341 2019 France 57,900 The 2019 final will take place at the Stade de Lyon, which has a capacity of 59,186. Sponsors of the 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup FIFA has six main partners Adidas, Coca Cola, Wanda, HyundaiKia Motors, Qatar Airways and Visa. In addition to these partners, FIFA.com and FIFA living football, the 2019 edition has six national sponsors. These event specific sponsors are Arkema a French specialty chemicals and advanced materials company Crdit Agricole a French fullservice banking group EDF lectricit de France is a French electric utility company Orange a French multinational telecommunications company Proman a French recruitment and workforce management company SNCF Frances national railway company Sponsors of the national teams cookie height100 width100 httpswww.instagram.compByPvVhRo6Tl cookie Six different brands sponsor the 24 World Cup teams.

The biggest test yet of that theory starts next week in Australia and New Zealand, with the latest edition of the Womens World Cup. In the four intervening years, the hierarchy on the pitch remains unchanged the U.S. is still the favorite to capture the title, which would make it the first nation ever to win three straight World Cups, mens or womens but off it, womens sports has experienced an unprecedented explosion in power and influence, highlighted domestically by the equal pay deal the U.S. womens national soccer team struck with U.S. Soccer in 2022. While this will indeed be the biggest global womens sporting event ever, having expanded to 32 teams and 64 matches, there are signs that the tournament might not live up to FIFAs lofty expectations, one that would have met or exceeded the moment womens sports is at long last enjoying. Since 2019, FIFA has launched an effort to maximize the value of its womens soccer properties by changing the way it sells media rights and sponsorship for those events. Both have failed to demonstrate a sure sign of the before and after demarcation of which Infantino spoke. The organizations 2023 annual financial report, to be released next year, will be telling. In 2019, FIFA generated 766 million in total revenue, up 41 from the 544 million it generated during the previous Womens World Cup year in 2015. Nearly half of that 2019 figure 342 million came from media rights revenue. While the U.S. rights have been locked up by Fox and Telemundo since 2015 as part of their deals to air the mens World Cup through 2026, FIFA sold the Womens World Cup rights separately from the mens rights in other countries based on the viewership success of the 2019 event. FIFA said that tournament reached a global audience of 1.12 billion, more than two times the number who watched the previous edition in 2015. The organization is projecting that global viewership for this summers edition could hit 2 billion. Last October, however, Infantino publicly criticized broadcasters for submitting unacceptably low bids that were 100 times less, even more than 100 times less than what they paid to air the mens World Cup. It took until last month after Infantino threatened a blackout in Europes big 5 soccer nations for FIFA to reach a deal with the European Broadcasting Union to air the matches in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Financial details of that deal were not disclosed, but FIFAs severe reaction to initial bids suggests the organizations expectations heading into the sales process were well above what the market would bear. Despite multiple requests, FIFA declined to make its chief business officer, Romy Gai, available to speak with Sports Business Journal and did not respond to written questions about the commercial performance of the 2023 Womens World Cup. Sponsorship status In addition to possible media rights underperformance, response to FIFAs public push to sell brands on marketing rights related to its womens properties appears to have been underwhelming. In December 2021, as part of the rising tide in interest around womens sports, FIFA announced the launch of a new commercial partnership structure that would allow brands to invest exclusively in sponsorship of its womens competitions. Previously, marketing rights for FIFAs womens events were available only as part of a package with its mens events. FIFA did not respond to an SBJ request seeking a full list of companies that have purchased marketing rights for this summers event, but through July 5 only two brands Visa and New Zealandbased technology company Xero are listed on FIFAs website as FIFA Womens Football Partners. That designation sits below FIFAs four toptier partners Adidas, CocaCola, the Wanda Group and HyundaiKia, each of which are global partners that have deals with the mens side as well. Between those top two tiers, FIFA appears poised to enter the event with six Partnerlevel sponsors, the same number as the 2019 Womens World Cup in France for which womensonly partnerships werent available and one fewer than the 2022 mens edition in Qatar. The website lists a total of 10 global sponsors, four fewer than FIFA had for the 2022 mens event and four more than the 2019 womens edition. Ricardo Fort, an Atlantabased sponsorship marketing consultant with inhouse experience at Visa and CocaCola, said FIFA was expecting to have a lot more brands coming up to become a FIFA Womens World Cuponly sponsor. For a tournament that happens in a time zone which is not friendly for Europe or North America, a tournament that lasts a month, that really gets exciting halfway through, the price that FIFA has been charging is probably frightening some potential partners, Fort said, estimating such an investment would run in the low eight figures. In 2019, the year of the last Womens World Cup, FIFA reported 164.8 million in revenue from marketing rights. It wont be possible to assess how sponsorship revenue for this summers event compares to past iterations until the release of FIFAs 2023 financial report next year. For Visa, a FIFA sponsor since 2007, the opportunity to be the first brand designated specifically as a Womens Football Partner was an appealing proposition. The company was also the first to sign on as a womensspecific sponsor with UEFA when the European federation made the designation available in 2018. The separating of the FIFA Womens World Cup from the mens World Cup just gave us the ability to continue our commitment to womens football in what I would say is a bit more dynamic way, said Andrea Fairchild, Visa senior vice president and head of sponsorships. Fairchild said the companys marketing spend around this years Womens World Cup exceeds any previous edition of the event. In addition to its FIFA relationship, Visa is a sponsor of the U.S. womens national soccer team through its deal with U.S. Soccer and has individual endorsement deals with 33 womens soccer players from 27 countries under the banner of Team Visa. Doubling down in the U.S. For its part, U.S. Soccer said it has seen significant enthusiasm from partners about this summers Womens World Cup. While U.S. Soccer doesnt sell Womens World Cupspecific sponsorships, CCO David Wright noted that 100 of the national federations corporate partners renewed their overall deals last year ahead of the mens World Cup in Qatar. They doubled down in the form of investment and doubled down in the form of activation, Wright said. In addition, U.S. Soccer last week announced a new multiyear partnership with CocaCola, the start of which coincides with this summers Womens World Cup. CocaColas sponsorship spend with U.S. Soccer is now the second largest for the federation behind only kit manufacturer Nike. Kelly Higgins, who serves as U.S. Soccers vice president of partnership marketing, said one way the federation sought to help sponsors engage fans domestically despite the time difference was by tying many sponsors activations to this past weekends sendoff match in San Jose against Wales. Bud Light, GoGo Squeez, Nike, Visa and Volkswagen all had key moments of their campaigns take place over the weekend. That was really a pivotal moment for us to really bring our partnerships and activations to life knowing that this was the last time the team would be here in the U.S. and wed be much closer to our fans from a onetoone basis, Higgins said. Representatives for members of the U.S. womens national soccer team also said that they have seen greater opportunities for their clients ahead of this summers Womens World Cup than in previous years. Dan Levy, executive vice president of womens sports at Wasserman, said more players now have offfield opportunities given the greater number of brands interested in investing in womens sports. The pie keeps getting bigger and bigger, Levy said. So where there was really room for maybe a few to take full advantage of it back in the beginning of this journey, now you have many more players benefiting from the commercial success and the amount of resources coming to the table. Levy, who represents Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, two of the most wellknown womens soccer players of all time, said players of their stature now have opportunities above and beyond simply endorsing products. Levy said he is focused on helping that duo build and create and own properties and companies. Both have launched their own media ventures in the past several years. Rapinoe teamed with her wife, basketball legend Sue Bird, on the creation of production studio A Touch More last year, while Morgan started lifestyle brand Togethxr in 2021 in conjunction with Bird, snowboarder Chloe Kim and swimmer Simone Manuel. Mike Senkowski, Octagon director of North American soccer, who represents forward Trinity Rodman, said the Washington Spirit star has added deals with Marriott and Unilever in recent months to a brand portfolio that also includes Adidas, Bose, Oakley and Red Bull and is worth a combined six figures per year. He said Rodman, whose fouryear, 1.1 million NWSL contract is the leagues largest, has seen her offfield earnings significantly exceed what shes making on the field. Remy Cherin, whose agency Remington Ellis represents seven of the 23 players on the U.S. roster, including star midfielder Rose Lavelle, said the number of inquiries he has received about working with his clients has roughly doubled compared to 2019, as have the fees that he has been able to command. Zoning out One likely issue for both broadcasters and brands in North America is the time difference between the region in which the tournament is being played and their home markets. On the East Coast in North America, most games will kick off between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. the following morning though the first two U.S. group stage matches begin at 9 p.m. ET. In the U.K., thats between 3 a.m. and 1 p.m. Neither daypart is ideal for maximizing viewership, which also potentially limits the value of the ingame brand exposure provided to FIFA sponsors. If youre a European or an Americanbased brand looking to associate yourself with this years competition, maybe the live match window isnt as important with the LED boards, but you still want to be part of the conversation, said James English, a U.K.based managing partner at Omnicomowned sports marketing agency Fuse. He suggested brands in that position might derive more value from a tieup with an individual federation such as U.S. Soccer or The Football Association in England. In addition, English said that while most industry observers suspected a broadcast deal would get done, the media rights uncertainty in Western Europe might have made some brands nervous about investing with FIFA. There has also been a stark lack of continuity atop FIFAs business operations. The organization rolled out the new commercial structure under Gais predecessor, Kay Madati, an American who left the organization last August after less than a year on the job. Madati took over following the departure of Simon Thomas, who had been in place for just over a year. One area where FIFA appears to have seen growth from the 2019 Womens World Cup is in the sale of regional supporter designations, which offer brands rights to be associated with the event in select geographic regions. After not signing any regional supporters in 2019, FIFA this year has deals with FritoLay and BMO for North America and Chinese electric twowheeled vehicle manufacturer Yadea in AsiaPacific. The location problem should be solved as early as the 2027 edition. Each of the four bids a joint U.S. SoccerMexican Football Federation effort, as well as ones in Brazil, South Africa and western Europe would be more timefriendly to U.S. and European television audiences and brands. There will also be a new U.S. media rights deal made to broadcast that years tournament, as it wont be bundled as part of the mens tournament. All of which suggests that the true beforeandafter moment may be yet to come.

Close 10 August 2023 Sponsors arent spending at the Womens World Cup Sports Sports sponsorship Strategy The current FIFA Womens World Cup has more teams than ever before, is better attended than ever before, has more TV viewers than ever before, has more sponsors than ever before, but sponsorship revenue remains a fraction of the mens event. Sponsorship revenue will be just 300m, according to data from analytical firm Omdia, cited by Bloomberg . Thats a mere 18 of the 1.7bn generated by the 2022 mens tournament in Qatar. Whats happening The success of last years UEFA Womens Euros confirmed a huge level of interest in the sport at this level, and there were widespread expectations that this years World Cup would cement brand interest. The likes of Unilever, Budweiser and McDonalds are on board, but theyre not spending at anything like the levels of the mens game. And it seems that brands not usually associated with the sport have passed up an opportunity to reach an engaged audience with significant spending power 8.9bn worldwide. Valuing womens sport Investing now, at a time when the sport is growing in popularity, could bring longterm benefits to brands as they help the future of the game. Observers complain that womens football remains undervalued, with brands and organisations expecting players to do things for free. Many top female players not only have significant social media followings but they often have higher engagement rates than male players. FIFA can be more proactive in raising the profile of the womens game between quadrennial competitions rather than making lastminute attempts to squeeze more money out of the sale of broadcast rights.

Needless to say, the world has changed and the goalposts have shifted somewhat in the eight and a half years since. The brainchild of Michel Platini, the erstwhile president of European soccers governing body, the plan to create a oneoff 'Euro for Europe' was concocted primarily due to a lack of singlenation bidders although the official line was that the national team tournament would be spread across an entire continent for the first time to celebrate its 60th anniversary. In any case, Platinis selfproclaimed romantic idea of staging soccers second largest international showpiece across multiple countries received broad support at the time. Here was a chance to take the coveted European Championship to cities and venues that had never hosted before, an unprecedented opportunity for fans from Ireland to Azerbaijan to unite and revel in a truly pancontinental festival of soccer. By September 2014, 13 cities had been confirmed to host matches , with Londons Wembley Stadium securing the semifinals and final, and Romes Stadio Olimpico given the opening fixture. Brussels was later relieved of hosting duties due to delays over the construction of its stadium but that minor alteration was nothing compared to the wholesale rethink that would follow. Like major event organisers elsewhere, Uefas plans were thrown into disarray by the Covid19 pandemic . Last summers tournament was swiftly postponed by a year as the virus spread across Europe in early 2020. The event retained its name and original identity , but just about everything bar the branding and official merchandise has had to be reworked due to the unprecedented health crisis. Michel Platini's plan to create a oneoff 'Euro for Europe' has been bent out of shape by the Covid19 pandemic Now, the prospect of 24 teams and thousands of fans crossing international borders at will throughout a 51match, monthlong occasion feels somehow out of sync with current circumstances. A patchwork of government restrictions will have to be worked around, new health and safety protocols imposed and sponsor activation plans scaled back, but the tournament will nevertheless kick off in the Italian capital on 11th June. Of the 12 initially confirmed host cities, only Dublin and Bilbao have been stripped of matches, their fixtures relocated to St Petersburg, London and Seville after local authorities in both cities failed to meet Uefas attendance guarantees. As such, 1 1 venues will welcome fans throughout the tournament , albeit with differing restrictions and spectator capacities ranging from 25 per cent in Munich to a full stadium in Budapest. Commercially speaking, Euro 2020 has attracted the support of several major brands, including Alipay , Booking.com , CocaCola, FedEx , Heineken, Hisense, Socar, Takeaway.com , Vivo and Volkswagen . TikTok and Qatar Airways were late additions to the fray having been confirmed as global partners in February, while Gazprom, an existing sponsor of the Champions League, expanded its rights to include Uefas national team tournaments as recently as May. Each of those companies, along with the usual smattering of global broadcasters and licensees, is helping finance a tournament that generated 1.93 billion US2.13 billion in 2016, a figure that was up 34 per cent on the prior edition four years earlier. Of the total revenue last time out, 480 million came from sponsorship and licensing and 1.05 billion from TV rights, with a further 400 million generated by ticketing and hospitality. The latter of those figures is set to be far lower this summer, of course, with Uefas income from matchday revenue streams having already plunged by 92 per cent to 3.8 million last season. Still, the mere fact that Euro 2020 is able to go ahead will bring welcome relief to Uefa. Platinis plan is at last coming to fruition, and the governing body can finally set aside lingering tensions in the club game to focus on its flagship international showpiece once again.

It will be a particular version, in every sense the public that will gradually return to the stadiums, will be a traveling version with eleven host cities , but above all it will be one of the most balanced and uncertain tournaments ever. On the one hand there is France which, with the addition of Karim Benzema, raises the bar even more, but on the other hand there are fierce young teams ready to annoy the world champions. The Johan Cruijff Arena in Amsterdam, the Olympic Stadium in Baku, the Arena Nationala in Bucharest, the Puskas Arena in Budapest, the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, the Hampden Park in Glasgow, the Allianz Arena in Munich, the Saint Petersburg Stadium in Saint Petersburg, Stadio de la Cartuja in Seville, the Olimpico and Wembley will be the stages chosen by UEFA to showcase the best players in Europe. Continental competitions are the best opportunities to understand part of the strategies of sports brands. The EURO 2020 sponsor atlas has six brands, but almost 90 of the teams focus on the big 3 Nike , adidas and PUMA . There are 9 national teams that will take the field with the Swoosh on their shirts Holland, England, Turkey, Croatia, Slovakia, France, Finland, Portugal and Poland. Different choice instead for Belgium, Spain, Wales, Scotland, Russia, Germany, Hungary and Sweden, the eight teams that will have the three stripes on the kits. Together with Italy, there will be the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Austria to wear PUMA. The brands that have a single representative are Hummel Denmark, Jako North Macedonia and Joma Ukraine. Unlike the 2016 edition won by Portugal at the Stade de France in SaintDenis against the hosts it is Nike that takes over the other brands with nine participating teams, while in the French European there were only six France, England, Portugal, Poland, Croatia and Turkey. adidas, on the other hand, goes from nine in 2016 to eight in 2020, as does PUMA, which loses Slovakia and goes from five to four. In 2016, in addition to the big names, there were also Errea with Iceland, Macron with Albania and Umbro with Ireland. adidas euro 2020 hummel jako joma nike puma What to read next Read now What was trending when the Total 90 III came out in 2004?

Questa volta invece per Euro 2020 il gioco risulta piuttosto facile e alla portata di tutti. Perch, di fatto, c stato un cambio della guardia. La lista degli Official Sponsor parla da sola. Oltre ai classici e immancabili CocaCola , Volkswagen, FedEx e Heineken in veste di rassicurante Vecchia Guardia pi come classi merceologiche che come brand al loro fianco arriva una nutrita compagine cinese il produttore di smartphone Vivo , i tv HiSense e la piattaforma di pagamento online Alipay , la grande azienda energetica russa GazProm una compagnia area araba Qatar Airways , aziende digital first Booking.com, Just Eat e il media partner che non ti aspetti TikTok, social network cinese. Leggi anche ce lo chiede l'europeo Danza con maschi tossici. Weekend davanti all'Europeo di uno che non ne sa niente Manuel Peruzzo Partiamo da questultimo. Dopo aver conquistato gli Stati Uniti oltre 100 milioni di utenti attivi e ovviamente la Cina 600 milioni TikTok aveva bisogno di entrare prepotentemente in Europa e, si sa, i numeri grossi si fanno con il calcio, indipendentemente dal target. Dallaltra parte la Uefa cercava un digital media perch il digitale stato il salvatore dellindustria delle sponsorizzazioni durante la pandemia. Con meno tifosi negli stadi, guardare gli Europei in tv rappresenta unesperienza ridotta, quindi c bisogno dellelemento digitale per riempire il vuoto e creare contenuti che potranno generare eccitazione, interazione e coinvolgimento. I primi numeri sono positivi il video di lancio di Euro 2020 di TikTok ha generato pi di 6 milioni di visualizzazioni e 160.000 interazioni. Il numero di visualizzazioni stato del 145 per cento superiore alla media dei post sul canale TikTok della Uefa nello stesso mese. Cos mentre il premier Mario Draghi dalla Cornovaglia promette una linea dura contro la Cina , le aziende cinesi si prendono tutte le sponsorizzazioni del comparto tecnologico, con al vertice Alipay, il sistema di pagamento online del gruppo Alibaba che ha preso il posto delle varie Mastercard o dei gruppi finanziari come Paribas le quali, fino a ieri, avevano forte visibilit in queste manifestazioni e che ora rischiano di perdere la scommessa sui pagamenti digitali. Peraltro le aziende cinesi non si vergognano di mostrare i cartelloni pubblicitari a bordo campo anche nella versione con gli ideogrammi. Un altro segno dei tempi la presenza dei brand di servizi digitali su comparti fondamentali come foodristorazione e accoglienza. Just Eat ha come obiettivo quello di aumentare il parco clienti e utenti, la notoriet, ma anche nel frattempo regolarizzare la propria situazione . La filiale italiana di Just Eat proprio ieri ha assunto 560 rider con il contratto Logistica e Trasporti, quindi con tutte le tutele di un lavoratore dipendente ferie, malattia, straordinario pagato e assicurazione in caso di infortunio. Un po pi difficile la situazione per Booking.com, almeno in Italia, che stata accusata di aver evaso oltre 150 milioni di euro di Iva. Tuttavia il fatto che questanno Euro 2020 si svolga in 11 citt europee differenti, d molte possibilit al brand di fare operazioni di marketing e promozionali su tutto il territorio europeo. Gli Europei di calcio sono, dopo la Coppa del Mondo FIFA e le Olimpiadi, il terzo pi importante e commerciabile evento sportivo al mondo secondo lUefa, Euro 2016 raggiunse un pubblico televisivo globale di due miliardi di persone, con ascolti in crescita in Brasile e Cina, rendendola unopportunit di sponsorizzazione estremamente preziosa per i brand. Questanno il giro daffari si attester a 1,3 miliardi di euro e con le sponsorizzazioni arriveranno circa 210 milioni di euro alle casse dellUefa, nonostante il calo del 9 per cento nel mercato delle sponsorizzazioni in Europa nel 2020 dati Nielsen Sports. E se voi per caso sorridete quando vedete la scritta Euro 2020 oggi che siamo nel 2021 sappiate che i manager di CocaCola sfoggiano un sorriso a 36 denti infatti a marzo 2020, quando inizi la pandemia, i lavori del marketing erano gi in pieno sviluppo ed erano gi in produzione 10 milioni di lattine con il logo Euro 2020. Se fosse cambiato il logo dellevento sarebbero dovuto essere eliminate, invece il progetto del packaging rimasto lo stesso, risparmiando molti soldi.

More information Accept Rate Bookmark Share The world soccer federation FIFA has an image problem Several sponsorship partners still on board in Brazil in 2014 are no longer in on the party for the World Cup in Russia June 14 to July 15. Companies from China are playing an ever larger role. An overview of all the 2018 World Cup sponsors and info on their payments. Author Lars Becker More on the topic Sports Business Sports Business How the USA is Revolutionizing Sports Entertainment 7 Key Trends You Need to Know Sports Business Outdoor Fashion 2025 Between performance, style and sustainability Sustainability Sustainability in transition why companies need to rethink in 2025 All about Sports Business Ibrahimovic is ambassador at the Fifa World Cup in Russia Image credit Screenshot YouTube Zlatan Ibrahimovic is coming to Russia for the World Cup. But Ibra isnt in on the mega event as a player instead, hes an ambassador for the World Cup sponsor Visa. Visa is innovative. Zlatan is innovative. Together, well help make sure fans dont miss a moment of the World Cup, says Ibra. Hes meant to mingle with fans, to maximize the advertising value for the global payment processor. Seven partners paying 32 million euros each In the end, Visa is said to have paid 32 million euros each year to be able to call itself a FIFA Partner. The highest and most expensive category of backers for the global soccer federation includes, in addition to Visa Adidas CocaCola Gazprom a Russian natural gas company HyundaiKia Qatar Airways and Wanda a Chinese enterprise group. The seven partners are permitted to advertise not just at the World Cup, but also at other world championship events. The Premium category, which can include a maximum of eight companies, is thus almost fully booked. In contrast, there are still major gaps in the other two classes of FIFAs new, threetiered sponsor concept. FIFA corruption scandal makes for dwindling sponsors Yet four years ago, at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, all 20 sponsor packages were sold out long before the beginning of the highlight. But the 2015 corruption scandal, including the arrest of highranking officials, has done serious damage to FIFAs reputation. Global companies like Emirates, Sony, Castrol, Continental, and Johnson Johnson have bowed out to avoid suffering any image damage. Register now and dont miss any of our key sports news Adidas believes in the World Cup Adidas pressed on to further changes in FIFA, remaining on as a sponsor. Ultimately, twelve of the 32 participant countries are outfitted elsewhere. When soccer is played, the world watches, says CEO Kasper Rorsted. The World Cup is our greatest visibility for our brand that is still true. Also contributing to the sponsor problems is the change in FIFAs marketing concept. In the second category, the FIFA World Cup Sponsors, only five of the maximum eight spaces have currently been sold. McDonalds Budweiser Hisense Mengniu Group Vivo are each paying between 8 and 20 million euros to also be able to advertise at the World Cup and the Confederations Cup. World Cup 2018 The Great Outfitter Duel Between Adidas and Nike Notable is the rapidly growing number of Chinese companies including Wanda, Hisense, Mengiu, and Vivo paying millions to advertise at the World Cup China has less of a problem with FIFAs corruption issues. The country also aims to apply to host the 2030 or 2034 World Cup. Chinese companies pay 835 million dollars, the bulk of the 2.4 billion spent on advertising for the World Cup. Image gallery The football shoes of the German World Cup stars in pictures Page 1 of FIFA also lacking regional sponsors FIFAs biggest problem is with its socalled Regional Supporters. This has 20 spaces, four for each of the major continental regions of the world. Only eight packages have been sold so far, the majority with gracious support from Russian president Vladimir Putin. Hardly anyone outside of Russia will be familiar with the European Regional Supporters Alfa bank, Alrosa diamond producer, Rostelecom telecommunications, and railroad company Russian Railways. Chinese scooter manufacturer Yadea was the first company to acquire rights for the Asian market. Just a few days before the World Cup came Luci technology and entertainment and Diking apparel, also from China. No packages have been sold thus far for the regions of North and Central America and South America . Only shortly before the beginning of the World Cup did FIFA land the first regional sponsor from Africa with Egypt. The North African country wants to advertise its tourism regions, and is the first new sponsor of the past five years not from Russia, Qatar, or China.

FIFA.com Media Release Fdration Internationale de Football Association FIFA Strasse 20, P.O Box 8044 Zurich, Switzerland, 41 0 43 222 7777 Thursday 06 April 2017, 0403 Organisation Hisense becomes Official Sponsor of 2018 FIFA World Cup Hisense, one of Chinas largest consumer electronics companies, has become an Official Sponsor of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia. The company has been number one in Chinese TV market shares for the last 13 years, and its success in China has helped to support the rapid expansion of its international business reach to over 130 countries around the world. It currently ranks third overall in all global TV shipments. As an Official FIFA World Cup Sponsor, Hisense will engage in various global marketing and advertising activities for both the FIFA Confederations Cup 2017 and the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Its logo will be associated with these two upcoming FIFA events and the company will have access to marketing opportunities both on and off the pitch, including advertising boards in stadiums and onscreen credits. In addition, Hisense televisions will be the official televisions of the competition. It is expected that the partnership will see Hisense reach over 200 territories and greatly enhance its international brand exposure. Speaking about Hisenses role as an Official Sponsor of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Liu Hongxin, President of the Hisense Group, said Over the years, Hisense has gained a lot of experience and seen strong brand growth through sports sponsorships. We are honoured to take on our biggest challenge yet, the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and we believe that the competition will vastly improve global awareness and economic value for Hisense as a truly international brand. The FIFA World Cup brings together the highest levels of competition and prestige in global football, making it the perfect sports event for us to be a part of.

Photo by Dorian Hurst on Unsplash Womens football has arrived and some more. This summer the FIFA Womens World Cup, the quadrennial international football competition for womens national teams, takes place. Hopefully the event will accelerate the sports worldwide growth even more. Below we take a look at a few of the business aspects of the 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup, from location to prize money and from attendance figures to sponsors. France hosts the 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup The 8th edition of the FIFA Womens World Cup takes place in France from June 7th to July 7th. Nine cities will host 24 teams across 52 matches with the final taking place in Lyon. France is not new to hosting FIFA tournaments, as the country already organised the 1938 and 1998 mens World Cup editions. cookie height100 width100 httpsx.comFIFAWWCstatus1110889475004121089 cookie Prize money at the 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup The prize money for the 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup has doubled compared to the 2015 edition. FIFA has set a total prize money purse of 30 million, with the tournament champions receiving 4 million. A figure that is also double the amount the 2015 champions USA received. Prize money 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup Place Prize money Winners 4 million Runnersup 2.6 million 3rd 2 million 4th 1.6 million 5th 8th 1.45 million 9th 16th 1 million 17th 24th 750,000 In addition to the 30 million prize money purse, FIFA will distribute 20 million for tournament preparations and the Club Benefits Program. Yet while there is an increase in price money, there is also an increase in the gap between prize money for men and women. During the 2018 World Cup in Russia the men teams were awarded a total of 400 million, with champions France receiving 38 million. This is a huge difference in any case and definitely for those advocating equal prize money. Several sponsors, spearheaded by Adidas, try to address this gap. The German clothing and sporting goods manufacturer announced that sponsored players on the winning 2019 FIFA Womens World Cup team will receive the same performance bonus as their male counterparts. Attendance figures of the FIFA Womens World Cup With womens football growing rapidly and attracting more and more attention, the gap between men and womens football will likely shrink in the future. Recently various matches across Europe had recordbreaking attendance figures. It is therefore expected that attendance figures will be quite high at the 2019 tournament. Especially since FIFA has announced that ticket sales for the competition are smashing records, with over 720,000 sold so far. So far the highest attendance figure at a FIFA Womens World Cup was during the 1999 final in the USA. At the Rose Bowl Stadium in Los Angeles the USA beat China in front of 90,185 people. The opening match of the same edition had an attendance figure nearing 80,000. The second highest final attendance was set in China in 1991. In the Guangzhou Tianhe Stadium 63,000 people saw the USA beat Norway. The 2015 final between the USA and Japan took place in front of 53,341 people in Vancouver, Canada.

In addition to these partners, FIFA.com and FIFA living football, the 2019 edition has six national sponsors.

With 24 teams, four debutants, nine host cities, 52 matches and only one winner, SportsPro presents its comprehensive guide to all you need to know before France play Korea on 7th June in Paris. 6 June 2019 Joe Levy Analysis SHARE THIS ARTICLE The Fifa Womens World Cup France 2019 is going to be the biggest womens sporting event of the year, says Sarai Bareman, Fifas chief womens soccer officer. Given the momentum, clamour and excitement for the eighth edition of Womens World Cup, that is hardly a bold statement. From fans to broadcasters, sponsors to players France 2019 looks set to be a significant moment in womens sport. A pinnacle in itself, but also a springboard to elevate the womens game beyond what has come before. More than 940,000 tickets have been sold so far across the nine host cities in France, with the opening fixture, semifinals and final all selling out within 48 hours of release. Visa has launched its biggest ever sponsorship activation for a womens soccer event across 33 individual markets. Teams have seen a wave of sponsors chomping at the bit to ride the seemingly everincreasing wave of womens soccers popularity. England have secured deals with Boots, Budweiser and Lucozade ahead of the tournament. Whilst it is cynical to be sceptical of the sudden appearances of major brands ahead of a global tournament, its shows that the reach of the Womens World Cup is expanding at a rate of knots. Broadcasters are producing slick, original and engaging content ahead of the tournament too. For the first time the BBC, the UKs public broadcaster, is giving the womens tournament the same editorial backing it gives the men. Fifa itself recently embarked on the rollout of its Womens Soccer Strategy, which aims to have 60 million women playing soccer by 2026. Whilst perhaps these are all endeavours that recognise that in the past too little has been done for womens soccer far too late, a focus on showcasing the womens game and developing commercial opportunities, alongside the grassroots and skills development, could well go some way to ensuring such mistakes are avoided in the future. However, all is not entirely rosy in the garden. Equal pay, treatment and recognition are still some way short of where they should be. The US team is in dispute with its national association the world's best player is absent, citing inequality as a main factor, and several sides still lack the support given to their male counterparts. Here, on the eve of the tournament, SportsPro presents its definitive Fifa Womens World Cup commercial preview.

The USWNT filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against US Soccer , the sports governing body in the States after it emerged national team female players on average earn US8,200 less than their male counterparts over a 20game international friendly calendar. Carlos Cordeiro, US Soccer president, said he was surprised by the complaint and that the body has provided the very best resources to the team and its staff. Luna Bar, a nutritional foods brand, donated US718,750 to the USWNT to compensate for the pay gap. Captain Carli Lloyd will be hoping for a second consecutive Women's World Cup title in France The Fifa Womens World Cup France 2019 is going to be the biggest womens sporting event of the year and the best Fifa Womens World Cup ever, says Sarai Bareman, Fifas chief womens soccer officer. Given the momentum, clamour and excitement for the eighth edition of Womens World Cup, that is hardly a bold statement. From fans to broadcasters, sponsors to players France 2019 looks set to be a significant moment in womens sport. A pinnacle in itself, but also a springboard to elevate the womens game beyond what has come before. More than 720,000 tickets have been sold so far across the nine host cities in France, with the opening fixture, semifinals and final all selling out within 48 hours of release. Visa has launched its biggest ever sponsorship activation for a womens soccer event across 33 individual markets. Teams have seen a wave of sponsors chomping at the bit to ride the seemingly everincreasing wave of womens soccers popularity. England have secured deals with Boots, Budweiser and Lucozade ahead of the tournament. Scotland, ahead of their firstever campaign, have secured a major deal with Spar. Whilst it is cynical to be sceptical of the sudden appearances of major brands ahead of a global tournament, its shows that the reach of the Womens World Cup is expanding at a rate of knots. Broadcasters are producing slick, original and engaging content ahead of the tournament too. For the first time the BBC , the UKs public broadcaster, is giving the womens tournament the same editorial backing it gives the men. Fifa itself recently embarked on the rollout of its Womens Soccer Strategy, which aims to have 60 million women playing soccer by 2026. Whilst perhaps these are all endeavours that recognise that in the past too little has been done for womens soccer far too late, a focus on showcasing the womens game and developing commercial opportunities, alongside the grassroots and skills development, could well go some way to ensuring such mistakes are avoided in the future. Ahead of the biggest womens sporting competition in recent memory, SportsPro presents its definitive Fifa Womens World Cup commercial preview.

It took place between 7 June and 7 July 2019, with 52 matches staged in nine cities in France , 1 which was awarded the right to host the event in March 2015, the first time the country hosted the tournament. The tournament was the first Women's World Cup to use the video assistant referee VAR system. This was the second and last edition with 24 teams before expanding to 32 teams for the 2023 tournament in Australia and New Zealand . The United States entered the competition as defending champions after winning the 2015 edition in Canada and successfully defended their title with a 20 victory over the Netherlands in the final . In doing so, they secured their record fourth title and became the second nation, after Germany , to have successfully retained the title. Unlike Germany, however, this victory held a distinction as the United States won both 2015 and 2019 tournaments under one manager, Jill Ellis . It was the first time in 81 years since Vittorio Pozzo did so for the Italian men's team at the 1934 and 1938 FIFA World Cups . The matches were broadcast globally and attracted a combined audience of 1.12 billion people.

The biggest test yet of that theory starts next week in Australia and New Zealand, with the latest edition of the Womens World Cup. In the four intervening years, the hierarchy on the pitch remains unchanged the U.S. is still the favorite to capture the title, which would make it the first nation ever to win three straight World Cups, mens or womens but off it, womens sports has experienced an unprecedented explosion in power and influence, highlighted domestically by the equal pay deal the U.S. womens national soccer team struck with U.S. Soccer in 2022. While this will indeed be the biggest global womens sporting event ever, having expanded to 32 teams and 64 matches, there are signs that the tournament might not live up to FIFAs lofty expectations, one that would have met or exceeded the moment womens sports is at long last enjoying. Since 2019, FIFA has launched an effort to maximize the value of its womens soccer properties by changing the way it sells media rights and sponsorship for those events. Both have failed to demonstrate a sure sign of the before and after demarcation of which Infantino spoke. The organizations 2023 annual financial report, to be released next year, will be telling. In 2019, FIFA generated 766 million in total revenue, up 41 from the 544 million it generated during the previous Womens World Cup year in 2015. Nearly half of that 2019 figure 342 million came from media rights revenue. While the U.S. rights have been locked up by Fox and Telemundo since 2015 as part of their deals to air the mens World Cup through 2026, FIFA sold the Womens World Cup rights separately from the mens rights in other countries based on the viewership success of the 2019 event. FIFA said that tournament reached a global audience of 1.12 billion, more than two times the number who watched the previous edition in 2015. The organization is projecting that global viewership for this summers edition could hit 2 billion. Last October, however, Infantino publicly criticized broadcasters for submitting unacceptably low bids that were 100 times less, even more than 100 times less than what they paid to air the mens World Cup. It took until last month after Infantino threatened a blackout in Europes big 5 soccer nations for FIFA to reach a deal with the European Broadcasting Union to air the matches in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Financial details of that deal were not disclosed, but FIFAs severe reaction to initial bids suggests the organizations expectations heading into the sales process were well above what the market would bear. Despite multiple requests, FIFA declined to make its chief business officer, Romy Gai, available to speak with Sports Business Journal and did not respond to written questions about the commercial performance of the 2023 Womens World Cup. Sponsorship status In addition to possible media rights underperformance, response to FIFAs public push to sell brands on marketing rights related to its womens properties appears to have been underwhelming. In December 2021, as part of the rising tide in interest around womens sports, FIFA announced the launch of a new commercial partnership structure that would allow brands to invest exclusively in sponsorship of its womens competitions. Previously, marketing rights for FIFAs womens events were available only as part of a package with its mens events. FIFA did not respond to an SBJ request seeking a full list of companies that have purchased marketing rights for this summers event, but through July 5 only two brands Visa and New Zealandbased technology company Xero are listed on FIFAs website as FIFA Womens Football Partners. That designation sits below FIFAs four toptier partners Adidas, CocaCola, the Wanda Group and HyundaiKia, each of which are global partners that have deals with the mens side as well. Between those top two tiers, FIFA appears poised to enter the event with six Partnerlevel sponsors, the same number as the 2019 Womens World Cup in France for which womensonly partnerships werent available and one fewer than the 2022 mens edition in Qatar. The website lists a total of 10 global sponsors, four fewer than FIFA had for the 2022 mens event and four more than the 2019 womens edition. Ricardo Fort, an Atlantabased sponsorship marketing consultant with inhouse experience at Visa and CocaCola, said FIFA was expecting to have a lot more brands coming up to become a FIFA Womens World Cuponly sponsor. For a tournament that happens in a time zone which is not friendly for Europe or North America, a tournament that lasts a month, that really gets exciting halfway through, the price that FIFA has been charging is probably frightening some potential partners, Fort said, estimating such an investment would run in the low eight figures. In 2019, the year of the last Womens World Cup, FIFA reported 164.8 million in revenue from marketing rights. It wont be possible to assess how sponsorship revenue for this summers event compares to past iterations until the release of FIFAs 2023 financial report next year. For Visa, a FIFA sponsor since 2007, the opportunity to be the first brand designated specifically as a Womens Football Partner was an appealing proposition. The company was also the first to sign on as a womensspecific sponsor with UEFA when the European federation made the designation available in 2018. The separating of the FIFA Womens World Cup from the mens World Cup just gave us the ability to continue our commitment to womens football in what I would say is a bit more dynamic way, said Andrea Fairchild, Visa senior vice president and head of sponsorships. Fairchild said the companys marketing spend around this years Womens World Cup exceeds any previous edition of the event. In addition to its FIFA relationship, Visa is a sponsor of the U.S. womens national soccer team through its deal with U.S. Soccer and has individual endorsement deals with 33 womens soccer players from 27 countries under the banner of Team Visa. Doubling down in the U.S. For its part, U.S. Soccer said it has seen significant enthusiasm from partners about this summers Womens World Cup. While U.S. Soccer doesnt sell Womens World Cupspecific sponsorships, CCO David Wright noted that 100 of the national federations corporate partners renewed their overall deals last year ahead of the mens World Cup in Qatar. They doubled down in the form of investment and doubled down in the form of activation, Wright said. In addition, U.S. Soccer last week announced a new multiyear partnership with CocaCola, the start of which coincides with this summers Womens World Cup. CocaColas sponsorship spend with U.S. Soccer is now the second largest for the federation behind only kit manufacturer Nike. Kelly Higgins, who serves as U.S. Soccers vice president of partnership marketing, said one way the federation sought to help sponsors engage fans domestically despite the time difference was by tying many sponsors activations to this past weekends sendoff match in San Jose against Wales. Bud Light, GoGo Squeez, Nike, Visa and Volkswagen all had key moments of their campaigns take place over the weekend. That was really a pivotal moment for us to really bring our partnerships and activations to life knowing that this was the last time the team would be here in the U.S. and wed be much closer to our fans from a onetoone basis, Higgins said. Representatives for members of the U.S. womens national soccer team also said that they have seen greater opportunities for their clients ahead of this summers Womens World Cup than in previous years. Dan Levy, executive vice president of womens sports at Wasserman, said more players now have offfield opportunities given the greater number of brands interested in investing in womens sports. The pie keeps getting bigger and bigger, Levy said. So where there was really room for maybe a few to take full advantage of it back in the beginning of this journey, now you have many more players benefiting from the commercial success and the amount of resources coming to the table. Levy, who represents Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, two of the most wellknown womens soccer players of all time, said players of their stature now have opportunities above and beyond simply endorsing products. Levy said he is focused on helping that duo build and create and own properties and companies. Both have launched their own media ventures in the past several years. Rapinoe teamed with her wife, basketball legend Sue Bird, on the creation of production studio A Touch More last year, while Morgan started lifestyle brand Togethxr in 2021 in conjunction with Bird, snowboarder Chloe Kim and swimmer Simone Manuel. Mike Senkowski, Octagon director of North American soccer, who represents forward Trinity Rodman, said the Washington Spirit star has added deals with Marriott and Unilever in recent months to a brand portfolio that also includes Adidas, Bose, Oakley and Red Bull and is worth a combined six figures per year. He said Rodman, whose fouryear, 1.1 million NWSL contract is the leagues largest, has seen her offfield earnings significantly exceed what shes making on the field. Remy Cherin, whose agency Remington Ellis represents seven of the 23 players on the U.S. roster, including star midfielder Rose Lavelle, said the number of inquiries he has received about working with his clients has roughly doubled compared to 2019, as have the fees that he has been able to command. Zoning out One likely issue for both broadcasters and brands in North America is the time difference between the region in which the tournament is being played and their home markets. On the East Coast in North America, most games will kick off between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. the following morning though the first two U.S. group stage matches begin at 9 p.m. ET. In the U.K., thats between 3 a.m. and 1 p.m. Neither daypart is ideal for maximizing viewership, which also potentially limits the value of the ingame brand exposure provided to FIFA sponsors. If youre a European or an Americanbased brand looking to associate yourself with this years competition, maybe the live match window isnt as important with the LED boards, but you still want to be part of the conversation, said James English, a U.K.based managing partner at Omnicomowned sports marketing agency Fuse. He suggested brands in that position might derive more value from a tieup with an individual federation such as U.S. Soccer or The Football Association in England. In addition, English said that while most industry observers suspected a broadcast deal would get done, the media rights uncertainty in Western Europe might have made some brands nervous about investing with FIFA. There has also been a stark lack of continuity atop FIFAs business operations. The organization rolled out the new commercial structure under Gais predecessor, Kay Madati, an American who left the organization last August after less than a year on the job. Madati took over following the departure of Simon Thomas, who had been in place for just over a year. One area where FIFA appears to have seen growth from the 2019 Womens World Cup is in the sale of regional supporter designations, which offer brands rights to be associated with the event in select geographic regions. After not signing any regional supporters in 2019, FIFA this year has deals with FritoLay and BMO for North America and Chinese electric twowheeled vehicle manufacturer Yadea in AsiaPacific. The location problem should be solved as early as the 2027 edition. Each of the four bids a joint U.S. SoccerMexican Football Federation effort, as well as ones in Brazil, South Africa and western Europe would be more timefriendly to U.S. and European television audiences and brands. There will also be a new U.S. media rights deal made to broadcast that years tournament, as it wont be bundled as part of the mens tournament. All of which suggests that the true beforeandafter moment may be yet to come.

For example if you look at the 20202021 Premier League shirt sponsors , 40 percent eight out of 20 of the shirt sponsors are gambling companies. In this years Champions League season 17 percent five out of 32 of the clubs have a gambling sponsor while last year there was only one three percent. So in which industries are the UCL teams sponsors active? We can roughly categorise the companies into 13 different industries. While there were 16 different industries last season note all 32 teams had a shirt sponsor last season. The telecommunications industry sponsors the most teams with six teams. Followed by the financial services, gambling both five and automotive three industries. Compared to earlier seasons fewer teams are sponsored by airliners. This season just two Manchester City and Real Madrid. In 20162017 there were six teams sponsored by an airliner, with Emirates sponsoring four teams. Breakdown of 20202021 Champions League shirt sponsors per industry Where do the shirt sponsors come from? To see where the shirt sponsors come from we looked at where the companies have their headquarters. Key takeaways Most of the shirt sponsors come from Europe 18, followed by countries that lie in Eurasia, the Middle East both four and North America three One Asian company completes the shirt sponsors 18 teams have a shirt sponsor from their home nation Germany, Russia, the UK and the USA have the most shirt sponsors all three 202021 Champions League shirt sponsors Team country Shirt sponsor Industry shirt sponsor RB Salzburg AUT Red Bull Beverage, media sport conglomerate Club Brugge BEL Unibet Gambling FC Midtjylland DEN Arbejdernes Landsbank Financial services Chelsea ENG Three Telecommunications Liverpool ENG Standard Chartered Financial services Manchester City ENG Etihad Airways Airline Manchester United ENG Chevrolet Automotive Atltico Madrid ESP Plus500 Online trading financial services FC Barcelona ESP Rakuten Internet ecommerce Real Madrid ESP Emirates Airline Sevilla ESP Marathon Bet Gambling Marseille FRA Uber Eats Online food ordering PSG FRA Accor Live Limitless Hospitality Tourism Rennes FRA Samsic Business services Bayern Mnchen GER Deutsche Telekom Telecommunications Borussia Dortmund GER 11 Telecommunications Borussia Mnchengladbach GER Flatex Online trading financial services RB Leipzig GER Red Bull Beverage, media sport conglomerate Olympiacos GRE Stoiximan Iroes Gambling Ferencvaros HUN Magyar Telekom Deutsche Telekom Telecommunications Atalanta ITA Plus500 Online trading financial services Internazionale ITA Pirelli Automotive Juventus ITA Jeep Automotive Lazio ITA Ajax NED Ziggo Telecommunications Porto POR MEO Telecommunications FC Krasnodar RUS Winline Gambling Lokomotiv Moscow RUS Russian Railways Rail transport Zenit St. Petersburg RUS Gazprom Oil and gas energy Istanbul Basaksehir TUR Decovita Ceramic Dynamo Kyiv UKR Shakhtar Donetsk UKR Parimatch Gambling 20202021 Champions League sponsors The Champions League lists eight official partners on their website .

These partnerships are the most lucrative on offer and contribute to ensuring the Champions League maintains its status. For the 2023 season, the UEFA Champions League accumulated 606.3 million in sponsorship revenue, according to GlobalData , a leading data and analytics company. GlobalDatas latest report, UEFA European Club Competition Finals 2023 Post Event Analysis , reveals that UEFAs second and thirdtier competitions, the Europa League UEL and the Europa Conference League UECL, generated approximately 314 million for the 2023 season, emphasising their popularity. The UEL and UECLs biggest partner, which doesnt include a deal with the Champions League, is Hankook, worth 17.5 million annually. Joe Pacinella, Sport Analyst at GlobalData, comments The Champions League allows the brands partnering with it to take advantage of the global exposure that comes with such a highvalue sponsorship deal. Nine of the Champions Leagues 14 sponsors are worth over 40 million annually, highlighting the high price for brands to partner with the competition and demonstrating how worthwhile the exposure is. The Champions Leagues deal with Heineken offers a huge source of revenue for the competition and resonates with fans as many associate soccer matches with drinking beer. The Dutch beer company has partnered with the competition since 2002 through Heinekens Amstel brand, illustrating the longevity of the partnership which has helped both parties build international recognition through TV and instadia advertising. Oppo, the Chinese smartphone brand, is a global sponsor of the Champions League, aiming to increase their brand awareness outside of China and Asia, whilst utilizing fan engagement by granting fans opportunities to experience Champions League matches pitchside. Pacinella adds Deals with Turkish Airlines, PlayStation and Expedia also offer a huge source of revenue for the Champions League, all worth 60 million annually, and provide solid foundations for its operations. Hankooks deal to sponsor the UEL and the UECL sees the Korean tire brand aim to increase its European footprint, while promoting UEFAs second and third tier competitions in the Asian market, having been partnered with the UEL since 2012 and has sponsored the UECL since 2021. Pacinella concludes Despite the huge commercial success of the Champions League, there is also high demand for UEFAs second and thirdtier competitions, with the UEL and the UECLs sponsorship roster boasting an average deal value of 24.15 million annually. In soccer, UEFAs three main club competitions are the most commercially dominant on the planet outside of the World Cup and the European Championship.

Derek Dougan, who after a successful playing career with Wolves and Northern Ireland had become the Chief Executive of Southern League Kettering Town, is credited with negotiating the first shirt sponsorship contract, a four figure deal with a local company, Kettering Tyres. The company name appeared on Kettering's shirts for the League match against Bath City on January 24th 1976 but the club were ordered to remove it by the F.A. just four days later. Instead 'Kettering T', which Dougan argued stood for Town, appeared on the club shirts until April 1976 when the F.A.'s patience finally ran out and they threatened the club with a 1,000 fine if the words were not removed. Together with Derby County and Bolton Wanderers, Kettering successfully proposed a change in the F.A. regulations to allow shirt advertising from 197778, although they were unable to find a sponsor for the new season. In the 1978 close season Derby County were the first League club to negotiate a shirt sponsorship deal, reaching an agreement with Swedish manufacturers Saab, although the sponsored shirts only appeared in the preseason photo shoot as pressure from the television companies had persuaded the FA and Football League to continue to bar shirt sponsorship. A year later Liverpool announced a three year shirt sponsorship contract with Hitachi and the flood gates opened. Clubs were compelled to wear plain shirts for televised games until 1983, when the TV companies finally gave way and allowed sponsors names on shirts to be broadcast. Football League regulations restricted the size of logos to a maximum of 81 square centimetres 32 square inches but for televised games they had to be half this size. Both the FA and UEFA introduced regulations governing shirt sponsorship in their own competitions. There have been frequent changes to the rules regarding kit sponsors by the governing bodies in the subsequent years, but they have been unable to agree upon a common set of regulations, hence the smaller sponsors' logos for European competition in comparison to those allowed by the Premier League. 1982 2000 Sharp Electronics UK United announced the club's first shirt sponsorship deal on April 27th 1982. The deal, with the Japanese consumer electronics giant Sharp, was initially for a two year period and commenced at the start of the 198283 season. The commercial partnership with Sharp, who had their UK head office and distribution centre in the Newton Heath district of Manchester, lasted eighteen seasons. The initial two year deal was worth 500,000. In March 1984 Sharp agreed to pay 700,000 for a further two seasons as the club's sponsor. 2000 2006 Vodafone On February 11th 2000, the club announced a 30 million four year sponsorship package with the world's largest telecoms company. The agreement, which initially ran from the start of the 200001 season, was extended for a further four years in December 2003 at a cost of 36 million. However on November 23rd 2005, in only the second season of the extension, a joint statement from United and Vodafone announced the deal would be terminated with effect from the end of that season. Vodafone had recently signed an agreement with UEFA, due to start in summer 2006, making the company an official partner of the UEFA Champions League and also the official mobile network of the competition. It is believed Vodafone had an opt out clause in their contract with United. 20062010 AIG United announced a record breaking 100 million 72m sponsorship deal with American insurance corporation, AIG on April 26th, 2006. The deal was for four years from the start of 200607, and eclipsed the previous record of 50 million over five years paid by Samsung to Chelsea. American Insurance Group AIG, the largest insurance Company in the world, were quoted as the 6th largest company in the world in the 2007 Forbes Global 2000 list. In September 2008 AIG were one of the victims of the global financial crisis, and were saved from bankruptcy only by an injection of 85 billion 47b by the US Federal Reserve. Eventually the bailout totalled 152 billion 100m. The continuing global recession prompted AIG to announce on January 21st 2009 that the contract with United would not be renewed after the initial deal expired in May 2010. United were reported to be already negotiating with potential sponsors, with Indian financial services company, Sahara, amongst the club's targets. 2010 2014 Aon United announced a four year sponsorship deal with US financial giant Aon on June 3rd 2009 the deal started in June 2010. Although the club did not release details of the sponsorship, a figure of 88m over the four years was widely reported in the UK press. 20142021 General Motors Chevrolet brand On July 30th 2011 with over three years remaining on their deal with Aon United announced a sponsorship deal with US car manufacturer General Motors. Although the exact value of the deal was not confirmed at the launch, the Reuters news agency reported it was worth 600m over seven years, and later reports in the British press confirmed United would receive around 370 million 53 million per season which easily beat the world record 125million paid by the Qatar Foundation to sponsor FC Barcelona. The sponsorship deal came six weeks after GM became United's official automotive sponsor in a five year deal signed in May 2012, and as a result of the agreement United bought out the remaining two years of the sponsorship deal with DHL for their training kits. The United shirts carried GM's Chevrolet brand from the beginning of the 201415 season. 20212024 TeamViewer On March 19th 2021, United announced a fiveyear shirt sponsorship agreement with the global technology company TeamViewer. One of the fastest growing software companies in Europe, the Germanbased company reportedly agreed to pay 47m per year. The deal was comparable to the 55m received by FC Barcelona each year from Rakuten. TeamViewer would be featured on United shirts from the start of the 202122 season. TeamViewer announced in August 2022 that the Company would not be extending the contract at its completion. In December 2022, United confirmed they had reached an agreement with TeamViewer which gave the club the option of buying back the shirt sponsorship rights. 20242027 Qualcomm Snapdragon brand On September 13th 2023, United announced they had negotiated a threeyear sponsorship deal with Qualcomm worth 60m. a year. United's shirts would feature the Snapdragon brand from the start of the 202425 season. Qualcomm have the option to extend the agreement fora further two years. Their CEO, Don McGuire, confirmed the annual paymentswere not contingent on United qualifying for the Champions' League. Snapdraon also had the option to place a charity's name on the shirts for one game per season to promote good causes.

100 Monkeys 100 Monkeys Naming Writing Ecosystems Contact About Resources menu close Football brands deserve more fitting sponsors By Eli Altman February 23, 2015 Reading Time 3 minutes Filed under Branding , Positioning Lets start with something really obvious football soccer for the Americans and Australians is the most popular sport in the world. Unlike the NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB, most professional football leagues allow for sponsorship on their uniforms. Considering all the interest, these sponsorships go for big bucks. Manchester Uniteds current deal with Chevy is around 80Myr . Given all the money involved, for the most part, these sponsorship deals go to the highest bidder. Chelsea is sponsored by Samsung, Bayern Munich is sponsored by Deutsche Telekom, Real Madrid, Arsenal, AC Milan, Paris Saint Germain and Hamburger SV are all sponsored by Emirates Airlines corporations that have very little to do with the location, history, or spirit of the teams they sponsor. The first football shirt I ever bought was a 1995 Newcastle United home jersey. I was 11 years old. I liked the shirt because the club was sponsored by Newcastle Brown Ale. Instead of being sponsored by a foreign airline or electronics company that had nothing to do with the club, Newcastle was sponsored by a popular beer from Newcastle. The companys logo even features the city skyline. The sponsorship actually made the shirt more desirable, not less. Les Ferdinand knows what Im talking about Some people will buy a team shirt no matter who the sponsor is. But in an increasingly brand conscious world, some corporate sponsorships are better for sales than others. Current Newcastle sponsor, the payday loan lender Wonga, has been under fire from Newcastle supporter groups for their unfair lending practices. One of their best players, Papiss Ciss , even threatened not to play because of the sponsor. So if most sponsorship deals are little more than a big money matchmaking, what would be the ideal clubbrand fit for some of footballs top teams? Manchester United While many clubs use the suffix United, saying you support United usually means one thing. Having a sponsor with a name to match would be mutually beneficial. Real Madrid Sure, Crown Royal might not have the money that Emirates does, but the fit couldnt be more perfect. The club of Spanish royalty with a crown on its crest gets a sponsor with a look and feel to match. AS Roma The Capitoline Wolf at the heart of Romes foundational myth graces the crest of Rome as well as the logo of Romebased Agip. AC Milan Both AC Milan and Milanfounded Alfa Romeo feature the Milanese Cross on their badges and have been foundations of the Northern Italian city for over 100 years. LA Galaxy Ok, Ok, the Galaxy are by no means one of the worlds top football teams. Hell, they were only founded in 1995. But as one of the most successful clubs in MLS and certainly one of the best named, we thought theyd be worth a mention. Herbalife, their current kit sponsor does have its roots in LA but SpaceX is far more thematically fitting. Arsenal While they might play at The Emirates and be sponsored by Emirates, the Gunners and their style of play need a fittingly aggressive sponsor. Canon seems to pair nicely. If you havent seen Papiss Cisss goal against Chelesa in 2012, you should really click on his name above.

Shaun BotterillPhotographer Shaun BotterillGe Bloomberg JPMorgan Chase Co. is to sponsor the most prestigious part of English football club Arsenal FCs Emirates Stadium in London, according to people familiar with the matter. The US banking giant becomes the first sponsor of Arsenals Diamond Club, a lounge that hosts wealthy fans who pay tens of thousands of pounds a season to watch the team, known as the Gunners, in luxury surroundings. JPMorgans branding was set to be visible during last nights match between Arsenal and Manchester United FC, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. The Diamond Club, nestled above the halfway line to provide the best view of the pitch, comes with heated seats and blankets to help fans cope with the English winter. It is named after deceased director Danny Fiszman, a diamonddealer who was instrumental to the construction of the Emirates Stadium, and features the gold Premier League trophy awarded to former manager Arsene Wenger after his team went a whole season unbeaten in 20032004. Membership to the club costs over 30,000 38,165 a year, according to two people familiar with the matter. Sports venues are pushing to increase offerings to highnetworth fans. Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia is spending 20 million to open a private club at the NBA teams arena with a 15,000 annual membership fee. The sponsorship deal was reported earlier in a social media post by an Arsenal fan blog. Representatives for Arsenal and JPMorgan declined to comment. Arsenal moved into the Emirates Stadium in 2006. The ground has a capacity of around 60,700, slightly smaller than the new stadium built by north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur FC. Arsenals American billionaire owner Stan Kroenke could reportedly try to expand the Emirates Stadium to once again boast the biggest club arena in London.

For an overview of the club, see Paris SaintGermain FC PSG's Neymar , Kylian Mbapp and Lionel Messi in 2021. Paris SaintGermain FC were initially fanowned and had 20,000 members. The club was run by board members Guy Crescent , Pierretienne Guyot and Henri Patrelle . A group of wealthy French businessmen, led by Daniel Hechter and Francis Borelli , would then buy the club in 1973. PSG changed hands in 1991, when Canal took over, and then again in 2006, with the arrival of Colony Capital . Qatar Sports Investments QSI have been the majority owners of PSG since 2011, currently holding 87.5 of the shares. Arctos Partners owns the remaining 12.5. Backed by the Qatari government, QSI acquired a majority stake in 2011 and then became the Parisian outfit's sole owner in 2012. PSG are therefore a stateowned club, which makes them one of the wealthiest teams in the world. In 2023, Arctos Partners acquired a minority stake in the Qatarfunded French team. QSI chairman Nasser AlKhelaifi has been PSG president since the takeover. However, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani , the Emir of Qatar , has the final word on every major decision of the club. He is both the chairman of the QIA and the founder of QSI. Upon its arrival, QSI pledged to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League . PSG have spent over 1.9bn on player transfers since the summer of 2011. These massive expenditures have translated in PSG's domination of French football but have not yet brought home the coveted UCL trophy as well as causing problems with UEFA 's Financial Fair Play regulations. PSG currently have the thirdhighest revenue in the footballing world with annual earnings of 806m according to Deloitte , and are the world's seventhmost valuable football club , worth 4.4bn according to Forbes . This financial growth has been supported by PSG's Qatari owners the team's onpitch success highprofile signings, including Zlatan Ibrahimovi , Neymar , Kylian Mbapp and Lionel Messi and lucrative sponsorship deals with the Qatar Tourism Authority , Nike , Air Jordan , Accor and Qatar Airways .

Football clubs and leagues are increasingly partnering with a variety of sponsors, such as clothing companies, airlines, tech industries, etc. These partnerships are not only lucrative but also essential for the financial stability and growth of the clubs. One of the newest trends in sports sponsorships is the involvement of gambling sponsors. In Finland, for example, the football league has been renamed Veikkausliiga, as the national betting agency Veikkaus has become the main sponsor of the league. Additionally, more and more residents in Finland visit nettikasinot platforms like Energy Casino, Igni Casino, and Boomerang, which further boosts the growth of this niche in the country. In the UK, betting sponsors such as Betway, Stake, and Hollywoodbets have signed recordbreaking partnerships with Premier League football clubs. UEFA, the governing body of European football, is also actively seeking sponsors from the cryptocurrency exchange sector for the 202427 cycle of the Champions League. The influx of such collaborations will allow brands to enhance their visibility worldwide. Accordingly, Paris SaintGermain PSG is a prime example of a club that has built a diverse and robust portfolio of partners. This strategy has not only elevated the clubs global status but also ensured a steady stream of revenue. Lets take a closer look at some of PSGs key partnerships. Partnership with Nike Paris SaintGermain PSG and Nike extended their partnership in 2019, marking the largest sponsorship deal in the clubs history, which will run until 2032. The 30year collaboration underscores PSGs status as a key global asset for Nike. The partnership supports not only the mens and womens football teams but also the handball section, emphasizing the clubs worldwide reach and success. PSG has won numerous football trophies and many titles in handball and womens football. The clubs brand has grown significantly, becoming a global sports franchise valued at nearly 1 billion. Nikes creative designs, like the 201516 Dark Light third shirt and the 201617 yellowaway jersey, have been popular globally. This collaboration has resulted in recordbreaking shirt sales, with more than half of the PSG x Nike range sold outside Europe. Nikes commitment to PSG reflects a shared vision for future growth and innovation, ensuring the club remains at the forefront of football fashion and performance. This partnership is a proof of the hard work and dedication of both brands, promising exciting developments and continued success in the years to come. Partnership with Qatar Airways Since 2020, Qatar Airways has been the Official Airline Partner of Paris SaintGermain PSG, and starting from the 202223 season, it became the Official Jersey Partner in a multiyear agreement. This partnership not only enhances Qatar Airways extensive sponsorship portfolio but also connects its brand with PSGs global fan base. The airlines Privilege Club is now the Official Frequent Flyer Programme of PSG, offering unique rewards to members. Also, Qatar Airways Holidays provides official PSG fan travel packages, allowing football enthusiasts worldwide to visit Paris and watch top players like Kylian Mbapp, Ousmane Dembl, Achraf Hakimi and Marquinhos. These packages include return flights, accommodation, and match tickets. Thierry Antinori, Qatar Airways Chief Commercial Officer, emphasized the growing strength of their partnership and the visibility gained by featuring on PSGs iconic jerseys. Marc Armstrong, Chief Partnerships Officer of PSG, highlighted the milestone of having Qatar Airways as their jersey partner, noting the airlines significant involvement in sports and its ambition. Partnership with ALLAccor Accor has extended its commitment with the club in a new capacity until 2026 at least. The ALLAccor Live Limitless logo is now featured on the sleeve of PSGs training jerseys. The focus of this renewed partnership is to use PSGs assets to engage ALLAccor members globally, offering unique experiences. Originally launched in 2019 to promote ALLAccor Live Limitless , this collaboration has provided members with unforgettable opportunities to meet top PSG players, enhancing brand awareness. This extended partnership with PSG will remain central to Accors strategy, continuing to attract and retain members worldwide through exclusive benefits and engagement. Partnership with Yassir Last year, Algerian super app Yassir signed a threeseason global partnership deal with Paris SaintGermain PSG, aiming to enhance its international presence. Yassir, known for its ondemand and payment services across North Africa and beyond, saw this collaboration as a strategic move to expand its brand. With operations in Algeria, Canada, France, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia, Yassir plans to leverage PSGs global reach to further develop its market presence. Until 2026, Yassir will enjoy significant visibility, featuring prominently on the LEDs at the iconic Parc des Princes stadium. Also, this partnership grants Yassir access to PSGs massive social media following, which boasts over 200 million followers worldwide. This exposure is expected to attract a larger customer base through creative marketing campaigns. The alliance with PSG underscores Yassirs ambition to grow beyond its current markets and become a recognized global brand. By aligning with one of the most popular football clubs in the world, Yassir aims to reach new heights in the ondemand services and payments industry, benefiting from PSGs strong brand and international fanbase. This partnership marks a significant milestone for Yassir, positioning it for continued success and expansion. Posted by Ed 20 May 2024, 1230 Follow Us

Feed Research News Live PortAI Markets Market Screener Learn Investment Wiki Resource Download Developer EN English Latest News Yesterday News Quote List Topic List Quote List The 15 Companies with the Widest Sports Advertising Reach 247wallst 2024.07.05 1630 I'm PortAI, I can summarize articles. Start The given information falls into the category of business related information. The summary of the information is about the top 15 companies with the widest sports advertising reach, including brands like Puma, ChickfilA, Budweiser, Powerade, Michelob Ultra, and Ford Motor Company. These companies have sponsorship deals and advertising presence in various sports events and leagues. One of the biggest places to advertise for any global brand is during a sporting event. Whether its a regularseason game, championship, or the Super Bowl, advertising during sports guarantees an existing audience. Brands like CocaCola, Gatorade, and Nike are staple names in the sporting world, so you can expect plenty of advertisements. However, a few names among the top most active global sports property brands will surprise you. If anyone placed a bet on ChickfilA being on this list, according to SponsorUnited , youd be walking away a winner. Using data from 82,000 brands, 160,000 sponsorship deals, and 75,000 social posts between January and October 2023, SponsorUnited compiled its list of active sporting brands with the widest advertising reach in descending order. Why Are We Covering This? Sports is a multibillion dollar industry that brings in marketers by the truckload. There is a good reason why 247 Wall St. is covering this many of these brands are publicly traded. Not only are many of these brands public companies, but they are also among some of the most important we cover on this website in general. Youll see car brands and multiple Fortune 500 staples, which makes this list fall perfectly in our coverage area. 15. Puma Puma is a household name that you can find across multiple sports. Sponsorship deals 198 Founded by the brother who established Adidas, Puma is a staple of the sports world. It sponsors some of the worlds most popular football clubs, including Manchester City, Switzerland, Austria, Iceland, and a halfdozen other national soccer teams. Along with national teams, Puma also works with individuals like international superstar Neymar Jr. and multiple other soccer male and female phenoms. These relationships have helped establish Puma as a premier name in soccer. 14. ChickfilA ChickfilA is a definite favorite fastfood brand. Sponsorship deals 213 Although ChickfilA is a surprising name on this list, it is still a major part of the sporting world. The fastfood company has long had a strong strategy with college sponsorships, introducing its food to events like the Peach Bowl, Sacramento Kings basketball games, and various other teams around the country. 13. Budweiser It should come as no surprise to see Budweiser on this list. Sponsorship deals 230 Budweiser is everywhere as the title sponsor of multiple NASCAR teams, such as Hendricks Motorsports and StewartHaas Racing. Its also the official beer of the World Cup during the 2026 mens tournament, which will take place across North America. Overseas, Budweiser has a strong sponsorship deal with the English Premier League, one of the most popular soccer leagues in the sport. 12. Powerade Powerade is working hard to replace Gatorade as the sports drink of choice. Sponsorship deals 231 As the official sports drink of the Olympic Games in 2024, Powerade is set to give Team USA everything it needs to bring home a giant bag of gold medals. Owned by CocaCola, Powerade has plenty of marketing money behind it to try and compete with its larger rival, Gatorade. Expect to see Powerade on the PGA Tour, at NASCAR races, and hundreds of NCAA events. 11. Michelob Ultra Michelob Ultra is a popular beer in sports stadiums. Sponsorship deals 245 As one of the official sponsors of U.S. Soccer, the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, and several MLS teams, Michelob Ultra is everywhere in sports. Michelobs focus on soccer is bound to pay massive dividends as its the most popular sport in the world. When you add in a deal with Lionel Messi, the sports most popular athlete, Michelob Ultra is on the right track with sports. 10. Ford Motor Company Ford has long been involved in sports marketing across different leagues. Sponsorship deals 250 It hardly comes as a surprise to see Ford appear on any list highlighting brands with major sports sponsorship deals. Over the last two years, Ford has locked up deals with the LPGA, Basketball Australia, multiple PGA golfers, and to make powertrains for the bestinclass Red Bull Formula 1 team. As this builds on the companys outstanding sports success, expect to see far more from Ford. 9. TicketSmarter TicketSmarter is the leastknown name but is working to change that. Sponsorship deals 286 Arguably the leastknown name on this list, TicketSmarter racked up 286 sponsorship deals during 2023. Where TicketSmarter does well is creating relationships and brand partnerships with colleges and then reselling tickets to their events. It also doesnt hurt that TicketSmarter partnered with ESPN Events in 2022 as the official reseller for over 40 collegiate sporting events. 8. McDonalds McDonalds needs no introduction as a popular brand with sports marketing. Sponsorship deals 307 While 307 sportsrelated sponsorships in 2023 might seem small for McDonalds, its still good enough to place it 8th on the SponsorUnited list. One of the biggest news in 2024 was McDonalds becoming the premiere sponsor of the mens and womens FIFA CUP through 2026. The company is also reportedly signing a deal with Ligue 1, the French premier soccer league. 7. Bud Light Bud Light is another hugely popular beer in the sports world. Sponsorship deals 330 As the official beer of both the UFC and the NFL, its no surprise to see Bud Light have 330 sports activations in 2023. Bud Lights NFL deal is reported to cost around 300 million per year to be the official beer of the NFL, which means its available at every game in every stadium. Add this to a sixyear deal with the UFC, and Bud Light will be a staple of many major sporting events. 6. Toyota Toyotas sponsorship of the last few Olympic games gave it plenty of sports cachet. Sponsorship deals 440 One of the worlds bestknown brands, Toyota, is still a bit of a surprise on the sports advertising side. However, in October 2023, Toyota became the NFLs official automotive partner in a multiyear deal. Toyota has long been the official automotive partner for the last few Olympics, ferrying athletes back and forth from events. This includes marathons, Grand Prix events, and many more sports activations. 5. Nike Nike has long been involved in the sports marketing world. Sponsorship deals 448 Nikes somewhat surprising fifthplace finish hides the fact that its brand remains everywhere. Its easy to think that Nike would be number one with its scale, and in 2023, Nike had 448 sponsorship deals. Nike is even equipping the German, Canadian, Japanese, and French teams for the Olympics and currently has around 17,000 individual athlete brand deals in 2024. 4. Adidas Adidas is one of the most popular sports shoe and clothing brands. Sponsorship deals 456 A brand that started with a focus on sports, the history of Adidas is everything you need to know about its position on this list. Dating back to 1924, Adidas shoes helped German athletes win gold medals in 1928 the rest is history. Today, Adidas clothing and shoes adorn athletes globally, and its sponsorship deals are more present than ever. Adidas is everywhere between tennis, soccer, track field, and fashion. 3. Gatorade Gatorade has long been the sports drink of choice for athletes. Sponsorship deals 493 Gatorade is a sports drink staple, which is not surprising on this list of the most active brands in sports. To be fair, Gatorade was first developed in 1965 for the University of Floridas studentathletes. Suffice it to say, sports are truly in everything Gatorade does, and its marketing is a complete reflection of its 58 years of promoting itself across 80 countries and hundreds of sports leagues. 2. Pepsi Pepsi is one of the most popular soft drink brands in the world. Sponsorship deals 499 Pepsi is second among the most active sports brands, a name that likely elicits few surprises. Most importantly, Pepsi attributes much of its success to its creative marketing strategies, including those it has used in the sports world. With a huge global and demographic reach, Pepsis sports partnership runs leagues, including IPL, MLB, NFL, NBA, UCL, and many more. 1. CocaCola It comes as no surprise that CocaCola is the most popular sports marketing brand. Sponsorship deals 938 According to the SponsorUnited data, with 938 total brand deals between January and October 2023, CocaCola is the most active brand in sports. This wont come as any surprise, considering CocaCola has been involved in celebrity marketing since 1900. CocaCola has been a worldwide partner of the Olympic Games since 1928, which only validates its position as the largest sports brand.

Every time you see our name associated with a sponsorship, you will find traces of participation, said Francesco Lagutaine, chief marketing officer at MT Bank, which has naming rights for the home stadium of the NFL's Baltimore Ravens. Participation in community rituals is how we measure our success. One thing that has changed over the last 25 years is the cost of stadium naming rights. Banks that inked deals in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including JPMorgan Chase and MT Bank, locked in lower prices than financial institutions that are in the market for naming rights today. Here are the 15 largest namingrights agreements between banks and U.S. professional sports venues for which data is available, ranked by total deal value. American Banker reviewed lists of sports venues as well as press releases and news reports announcing the partnerships to determine the biggest deals sponsored by banks. The financial terms of some namingrights deals have not been disclosed. Baseball stadiums dominate the list, but a football stadium takes the top spot, and four basketball venues also make the top 15. SoFi Stadium 400 million from 2009 to 2029 SoFi's 2019 bid for the naming rights to the California stadium shook the sports advertising world with a deal worth 625 million , the largest sum on record. SoFi Stadium is home to both the Los Angeles Chargers and the Los Angeles Rams. It hosted the 2022 Super Bowl and is set to host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2028 Summer Olympics. Since its opening less than three years ago, SoFi has also hosted soldout shows for bigticket performers including Taylor Swift and the Kpop band BTS. Citi Field 400 million from 2009 to 2029 When it was announced in November 2006, Citigroup's deal to name the thenunconstructed Queens home of the New York Mets was the biggest on record. Then in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Citi faced pressure from investors to cancel the expensive deal. Citi stuck with its agreement and promised not to use any of the 45 billion in government funding from the Troubled Asset Relief Program during the financial crisis to pay for the sponsorship. Adobe Stock Chase Center At least 300 million from 2016 to 2036 JPMorgan Chase's agreement for the naming rights at the San Francisco home of the NBA's Golden State Warriors cost at least 300 million and up to 400 million, according to the Sports Business Journal . This is a great example of our commitment to the Bay Area, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement announcing the partnership. JPMorgan's deal for the naming rights to Chase Field in Phoenix back in 1998, which is number 13 on this list, came at a fraction of the price. Adobe Stock Truist Park 250 million from 2014 to 2039 Truist had to install the signs at the home ballpark of the Atlanta Braves twice within a threeyear period after it agreed to the namingrights deal just a few years before a major merger. SunTrust Banks inked a 25year deal for naming rights at the suburban Atlanta ballpark starting in 2017. Two years later, SunTrust merged with BBT in a 28 billion deal, and was renamed Truist. Truist is among the most prolific banks when it comes to naming rights. The Charlotte, North Carolinabased bank also sponsors the following stadiums in its home state Truist Stadium in WinstonSalem and Truist Field in Charlotte, both of which are used for minorleague baseball, and Truist Stadium in Greensboro, which hosts North Carolina AT's home football games. U.S. Bank Stadium 220 million from 2015 to 2040 U.S. Bank secured naming rights to the Minneapolis football stadium a year before its opening in 2016. The building, which is home to the NFL's Minnesota Vikings, hosted the Super Bowl in 2018. Former U.S. Bank CEO Richard Davis had wanted his bank's name on a Minneapolis sports facility since he took the helm in 2006, he told the MinneapolisSt.Paul Business Journal after the deal was announced. There is no better way to tell the community and, more importantly, your employees, that you are greatly devoted to the community you live in than if you are going to do something like naming a stadium, Davis said. Bloomberg News Barclays Center 200 million from 2009 to 2029 The British bank Barclays had planned an expansion into U.S. retail banking before the financial crisis. Its 2007 deal to sponsor a yettobebuilt Brooklyn arena was meant to help introduce the bank to a U.S. customer base. Amid the financial crisis in 2009, the parties renegotiated the original deal from 400 million over 20 years down to 200 million. Today, the Barclays arena is home to the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA's New York Liberty. The deal allows either Barclays or the Nets to opt out after 10 years, paving the way for a potential name change. Adobe Stock Bank of America Stadium 140 million from 2004 to 2024 Bank of America's deal with the NFL's Carolina Panthers turns 20 in 2024. The bank will have to decide whether to extend its 140 million sponsorship agreement for the Charlotte stadium, which is also home to Charlotte FC of Major League Soccer. When Bank of America secured naming rights in 2004, its thenCEO, Ken Lewis, was adamant on the future of the bank's relationship with the Panthers. This stadium will never be renamed again, Lewis said, according to the Charlotte Business Journal . Adobe Stock TD Garden 120 million from 2005 to 2025 TD Bank signed a 20year extension of its agreement with the home of the NBA's Boston Celtics and the NHL's Boston Bruins earlier in 2023. The parties didn't disclose the deal's terms, but the overall cost was likely higher than the original contract negotiated in 2005, according to the Boston Globe . We are proud to deepen our commitment to Boston and Greater New England by extending our naming rights to one of the world's most recognizable and beloved arenas, Leo Salom, CEO of TD Bank, said in a January statement . Valerie PleschBloomberg Capital One Arena 100 million from 2017 to 2027 Capital One Financial snagged rights for Washington, D.C.'s largest arena from Verizon in 2017. The McLean, Virginiabased lender agreed to pay 100 million over 10 years to put its name on the home arena of professional teams including the NBA's Washington Wizards, the WNBA's Washington Mystics and the NHL's Washington Capitals. As a top local employer, Capital One has deep roots in Washington, D.C., Kleber Santos, then the president of Capital One's retail bank, said in a statement. Albert Evangelista BMO Stadium 100 million from 2023 to 2033 BMO took over from Banc of California when it snagged naming rights for the Los Angeles soccer stadium in early 2023. The namingrights deal should promote BMO's brand among potential new customers, not just Los Angeles FC and Angel City FC fans. BMO is working on expanding on the West Coast after its parent company, Bank of Montreal, agreed to buy Bank of the West in 2021. The 16.3 billion deal closed earlier this year, and BMO has set the systems conversion for September . Adobe Stock Citizens Bank Park 95 million from 2003 to 2028 In 2003, Citizens agreed to a 95 million deal that included naming rights to the Philadelphia baseball stadium. At the time, Citizens was part of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which decided to divest Citizens in 2013. Under the terms of the namingrights deal, Citizens is also the only financial services firm allowed to advertise on television and radio broadcasts of Phillies games. This partnership is a grand slam for Citizens Bank, the Phillies and their fans, Stephen Steinour, then the CEO of Citizens, said in a statement at the time. Chase Field 66.4 million from 1998 to 2028 JPMorgan Chase's predecessor Bank One Corp. bought the naming rights to the downtown Phoenix ballpark when the stadium opened in 1998. Since then, the Arizona Diamondbacks have won five division series championships and the franchise's lone World Series championship in 2001. The field's name changed to Chase Field after JPMorgan Chase's 2004 purchase of Bank One . Adobe Stock Comerica Park 66 million from 1998 to 2028 Comerica Bank sent shockwaves through the Upper Midwest when it moved its headquarters to Dallas in 2007 . At the time, the bank was in the first 10 years of a 30year namingrights deal with the Detroit Tigers' baseball stadium, which kept the name Comerica Park. The bank and baseball franchise extended the deal in 2018, guaranteeing the stadium is called Comerica Park through 2034. Comerica Bank and the Tigers have a rich history in Detroit, and our ballpark sponsorship has allowed us to celebrate that history, Michael T. Ritchie, Michigan president of Comerica, said in a statement. Adobe Stock MT Bank Stadium 60 million from 2018 through 2027 MT Bank's headquarters are in Buffalo, New York, but the bank's presence stretches throughout much of the Northeast and the MidAtlantic region . In Baltimore, the bank's name is atop MT Bank Stadium, or The Bank, as locals know it. MT first signed a naming agreement with the NFL's Baltimore Ravens in 2003, then renewed the deal in 2014 and again this year. The most recent 10year extension guarantees MT's naming rights through 2037. MT declined to share financial specifics but said the extension had similar parameters as the original deal, along with an upward adjustment for inflation. Adobe Stock EverBank Stadium 43 million from 2014 to 2024 EverBank Financial's 10year, 43 million deal for naming rights to the home of the Jacksonville Jaguars is set to end in 2024. EverBank has owned the rights since 2010, but the stadium hasn't kept the same name over the past decade. New Yorkbased TIAA Bank bought Jacksonville, Fla.based EverBank in 2017 for 2.5 billion, at first operating the banks as separate brands and leaving the stadium named after EverBank. TIAA officially changed EverBank's name to TIAA Bank in 2018, and the football stadium's name became TIAA Bank Field. After another sale, TIAA said it will rebrand as EverBank , and the home stadium of the Jaguars will again become EverBank Stadium for the 2023 season.

With a downward trend seemingly present. However, with varying number of nations participating between 10 and 16 and different nations invited, a clearcut comparison is difficult. Between 1999 and 2015 the tournament had 12 participating nations. With the number of brands decreasing significantly from 10 to seven at the 2007 edition. At the commemorative Centenario edition in 2016, the tournament expanded to 16 nations. The number of brands increased slightly to eight. During the last three editions, despite varying number of teams participating 2019 12 nations 202110 nations 2024 16 nations, the number of different brands has remained at five. With Adidas, Marathon, Nike, and Puma sponsoring at least one team at all three editions. What did the Copa Amrica champions and runnersup wear? During the last nine editions 19992021, Nike has sponsored five champions. The most during that period. Puma sponsored Uruguay and Chile during their championship runs in 2011 and 2015 respectively. While Reebok and Adidas sponsored the champions in 2001 Colombia and 2021 Argentina. The runnersup during those editions have worn five different brands. Adidas sponsored five runnersup, all between 2004 and 2016. On four occasions it was Argentina who came up short in Adidas kits.

There have been four Adidas vs Nike finals, with the Nikesupplied teams coming out on top on three occasions. Which brands have dominated in Copahistory? It is often Adidas, Nike and Puma who sponsor the most teams across the Big Five leagues and at major tournaments, such as the European Championship. While these brands also dominate at the Copa Amrica, Marathon matches these brands presence at the Copa. The Ecuadorian brand has provided kits 18 times between 1999 and 2024. Coming third, only behind Adidas 35 times and Nike 20 times. Marathon also sponsored at least one nation at each of the ten tournaments during this period. Nike and Puma were the only other two brands to do so. Adidas has dominated the Copa Amrica since 2007. Apart from 2021, they sponsored the most teams at the various editions. At the Copa 2024, the German brand even sponsors 50 percent of the participating teams. At the 1999 and 2001 editions, Adidas, Marathon, Nike and Puma were not dominating the field yet. Reebok and Atletica sponsored the most teams both three nations in 1999 and 2001 respectively. Kit sponsors at the 2024 Copa Amrica compared to the European Championship 2024 and 2022 World Cup When it comes to brand variety in relative terms, the Copa Amrica 2024 ranks between the 2022 World Cup and 2024 Euros.

At the 2024 European Championship there are six different brands sponsoring the teams. Only one more than at the Copa, despite the number of participating nations 24 being 50 percent higher. Nike sponsors nine teams, while Adidas has six teams and Puma four in its portfolio. Joma, Macron, and Hummel also sponsor at least one nation. Yet the three are not represented at the 2024 Copa Amrica. At the 2022 World Cup, there were nine brands sponsoring the 32 nations . With double the field and a more international field, more brands were to be expected. Nike sponsored the most nations with 13, followed by Adidas with seven. Together with Puma, these brands sponsored over 80 percent of the teams in Qatar. Majid Iran, Kappa Tunisia, One All Sports Cameroon, and New Balance Costa Rica are brands that sponsored a team at the World Cup but are not supplying any nations at the Euros or Copa in 2024.

Absolut Sport is also the official agency for the CONMEBOL Libertadores Final and the CONMEBOL Sudamericana Final. Betano official sponsor In early February, Betano, the sports betting brand owned by Kaizen Gaming, made headlines by securing a significant partnership with CONMEBOL for both the 2024 and 2028 editions of Copa America. This partnership marks a major milestone in Betanos ongoing global expansion strategy. Betanos 2024 marketing campaigns across multiple continents reflect a wellorchestrated strategy aimed at solidifying its presence in key markets. The brand currently operates in South America, with a notable presence in Chile, Peru, and Ecuador. Additionally, Betano has been authorized to attract users in Canada, further broadening its reach. In midMay 2024, Betano was the first to apply for a local license to operate in Brazil under the countrys new government decree. This decree allows foreign companies to establish subsidiaries in Brazil, provided they set up a local customer service center operating 247 in Portuguese. Even before receiving official approval, Betano has already taken over as the title sponsor of Brazils Serie A and holds the rights to the prestigious Copa do Brasil. This move significantly strengthens Betanos footprint in the Brazilian sports market, complementing its existing sponsorships with major football clubs like Atltico Mineiro. httpsyoutu.be8Ymgz40Qag?featureshared Additionally, in late November 2023, UEFA announced that Betano had become an official global sponsor of UEFA EURO 2024, further enhancing the brands visibility and influence in international football. Thus, for Copa America spectators in the coming week, the daily schedule may look like in this post by Betano. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Betano Chile betanochile Originally established as the Stoiximan brand in Greece in 2012, Betano has grown to become a partner of numerous football clubs worldwide. These include prominent clubs like Benfica, Porto, and Sporting in Portugal PAOK, Olympiakos, and Panathinaikos in Greece Sparta Prague and Viktoria Plzen in the Czech Republic and Universidade de Chile. Additionally, Betano has secured the naming rights for the Argentine Professional Football League, now known as the Betano Tournament.

Commenting about this partnership, Betsson Groups CEO, Jesper Svensson said, The rationale behind sponsoring one of the biggest moments of the worlds sports calendar in 2022 is very simple Betssons commitment to sport and its support for gender equality.

Besides the exciting potential of further raising Betssons brand awareness in the region, we are extremely proud to be partnering with CONMEBOL as they are exceptionally committed with improving womens football in South America. They are members of the UNs Global Pact Target Gender Equality program and are the only confederation that requires mens clubs participating in its tournaments to have two womens football teams, at both youth and senior levels. Moreover, CONMEBOLs women representation is inspiring with some 42 of its officials, 55 of its managers and 18 of its directors being female. At Betsson we have similar representation with approx. 40 of our workforce identifying as female, concluded Jesper Svensson. CONMEBOL values the support of Betsson for one of its most important tournaments, the CONMEBOL Copa America Femenina 2022. This partnership comes from a shared vision between CONMEBOL and this prestigious company of boosting womens football across South America with a strong participation of girls, young adults and women Juan Emilio Roa, Commercial and Marketing Director from CONMEBOL said.

Besides being the best performing continent in the 2019 World Cup, LatAm saw the highest growth in TV audience 560 from 2015 to 2019 and CONMEBOL Copa Amrica Femenina 2018 in Chile reached a record audience of more than 20 million viewers.
